Households with one or more survey participants whose HIV status was unknown were eligible to participate in the trial. Eligible households were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to either receive no incentive, receive a fixed US$2 incentive, or participate in a lottery for $5 or $10 if the participant presented for HIV testing and counselling at a local primary health-care centre. The survey fieldworkers who enrolled participants were not blinded to trial arm allocation, but the statistician was blinded for analysis of outcome. The primary outcome was the proportion of households in which at least one child had an HIV test within 4 weeks of enrolment. HIV test uptake in the incentivised groups was compared with uptake in the non-incentivised group using logistic regression, adjusting for community and number of children as fixed effects and research assistant as a random effect.

Children were unavailable in 148 households in the no-incentive group, 63 households in the $2 incentive group, and 81 households in the lottery group. 1688 households had at least one child with unknown HIV status and were enrolled into the trial. 22 households had no undiagnosed child, and one household refused consent. The primary outcome of HIV testing was assessed in 472 (28%) households in the no-incentive group, 654 (39%) households in the $2 incentive group, and 562 (33%) households in the lottery group. At least one child was HIV tested in 93 (20%) households in the no-incentive group, in 316 (48%) households in the $2 incentive group (adjusted odds ratio 3&#x000b7;67, 95% CI 2&#x000b7;77&#x02013;4&#x000b7;85; p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001), and in 223 (40%) of 562 households in the lottery group (2&#x000b7;66, 2&#x000b7;00&#x02013;3&#x000b7;55; p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001).

The crucial step to accessing HIV treatment is HIV testing and counselling. The prevalence of undiagnosed HIV is particularly high in older children and adolescents, and coverage of ART is therefore much lower than in adults. Existing HIV testing and counselling strategies either exclude or are insufficient to meet the needs of this age group. Novel strategies will be required if we are to meet the ambitious UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets in this age group, which stipulate that 90% of HIV-infected individuals should be diagnosed. Incentivisation is a strategy that has been used in various public health programmes to influence health-related behaviour or to achieve specific targets. The effect of incentives on uptake of HIV testing has been investigated in two recent systematic reviews. We searched the Cochrane Review database, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, the WHO International Clinical Trial Registry, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science with the terms &#x0201c;HIV&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;incentives&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;voucher&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;lottery&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;conditional cash transfer&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;prize draw&#x0201d; for papers not included in the systematic reviews. We identified one randomised controlled trial from the USA, one randomised controlled trial from Malawi, and two observational studies in high-risk groups (unemployed men and adolescents) in South Africa. In all the studies, uptake of HIV testing was higher in the incentivised groups than in the non-incentivised groups, but none of the studies used a lottery approach. The only randomised controlled trial investigating the effect of incentives in sub-Saharan Africa was focused on adults and was done in 2004, before ART became widely available.</p><p id="para60"><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p id="para70">Our study is the first randomised controlled trial to test incentives to improve uptake of HIV testing by older children and adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa. Notably, use of the household as the unit of randomisation acknowledges the central role of the family and caregiver in making the decision about whether the child or adolescent is tested or not. We used two different incentivisation strategies, namely a fixed incentive of US$2 or a lottery with a one in eight chance to receive $5 or $10. Although uptake of HIV testing was higher in households randomised to fixed incentives than in households receiving no incentives, participation in the lottery tripled uptake. Lottery might be a more cost-effective strategy in resource-constrained settings and potentially less coercive because the participant is aware that an incentive might not be forthcoming. The strategy has potential for scalability and sustainability for identifying children with HIV acquired perinatally because there is no ongoing risk until sexual debut.</p><p id="para80"><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p id="para90">Financial incentives show promise for improving engagement in HIV testing, especially in high-risk groups.

The trial was done and analysed according to the CONSORT guidelines, and ethical approval was obtained from the Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe, the London School of Hygiene &#x00026; Tropical Medicine Ethics Committee, and the Institutional Review Board of the Biomedical Research and Training Institute, Harare, Zimbabwe.</p><p id="para130">The trial was nested within a household survey to estimate the prevalence of undiagnosed HIV in children aged 8&#x02013;17 years in seven communities in Harare. As part of the prevalence survey, participants were anonymously tested for HIV by providing oral fluid samples. Participants and caregivers did not receive these results. Each community is served by primary health-care clinics that provide acute and antenatal care services. The survey took place between Jan 1, and Dec 18, 2015.</p><p id="para140">Results of the prevalence survey have been reported.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> In brief, a sample of census enumeration areas, defined as the smallest delimited census area in the study communities, was selected from the 2012 National Census sampling frame using simple random sampling. All households in the selected census enumeration areas were enumerated, and any household with one or more residents aged 8&#x02013;17 years was eligible to participate in the prevalence survey. Households were eligible for the trial if they included at least one prevalence survey participant whose HIV status was unknown.</p><p id="para150">Written informed consent in Shona was sought from the caregiver and assent from the participants.

US$ has been the official currency in Zimbabwe since 2009.

Random allocation was built into the tablet used for data collection. Participants who were randomly assigned to the lottery had a one in eight chance of winning $5 or $10. There was no separate draw for $5 and $10 because both were in the same box at each clinic. Randomisation was done at the household level because it was not feasible to allocate participants in one household to different trial arms. An independent statistician used Stata version 14.0 to randomly allocate households. Randomisation was done on the basis of the list of households enumerated before the prevalence survey. This included households that were subsequently deemed ineligible because they did not have a child in the target age group. However, we randomised the enumerated households rather than those eligible for the survey to prevent fieldworkers from influencing allocation. If more than one survey participant from a household who was randomised to the intervention groups attended testing, each would be given the incentive.</p><p id="para170">Because the trial was embedded in the prevalence survey, the survey fieldworkers enrolled children into both the survey and the trial, and recruitment into the trial occurred on the same visit as that for enrolment into the prevalence survey.</p></sec><sec id="cesec50"><title>Procedures</title><p id="para180">Fieldworkers visited eligible households and, after obtaining informed consent, collected data on household sociodemographic characteristics. If a child from an eligible household was absent at the first visit, two additional visits were made within 2 weeks unless the household head reported the child was expected to be absent for more than 2 weeks (in which case the child was coded as unavailable). History of previous HIV testing, including the date and location of the test (or tests) and whether participants were taking ART or co-trimoxazole prophylaxis, was recorded for each participant with a questionnaire administered to the participant's caregiver. Participants were asked to provide documentary evidence of previous HIV testing, and all participants underwent anonymised HIV testing.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> All households participating in the prevalence survey were provided with written information about the benefits of HIV testing.</p><p id="para190">Households with at least one survey participant who had either no documented evidence of a positive HIV test, had a negative HIV test result more than 6 months ago, or had never tested for HIV were invited to participate in the trial. Participants were given vouchers stating their survey study number and the trial arm to which their household had been assigned. Free HIV testing at primary health-care clinics was available for all trial participants and other members of the household at any time, but incentives were only provided for those with a trial voucher. Research assistants were available at the clinics for HIV testing and counselling. HIV testing was done according to national guidelines, and those who tested HIV positive were referred for HIV care at the same clinic. As per national guidelines, HIV testing required both caregiver consent and child assent. Staff at the clinics and the research assistant had repeated training to provide age-appropriate information, testing, and counselling to prevent coercion. A research assistant based at the clinics reported any adverse events and ensured appropriate follow-up and linkage to care for any child diagnosed with HIV.</p></sec><sec id="cesec60"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="para200">The primary outcome was proportion of households with at least one child taking an HIV test within 4 weeks of enrolment.

Odds ratios were estimated with logistic regression to compare household HIV testing uptake (ie, at least one child testing for HIV) between the intervention arms and the control group, adjusting for community and number of children in the household as fixed effects and research assistant as a random effect. Adjustment for community and research assistant were made a priori. Adjustment for number of children was done to account for imbalance in different trial arms. Logistic regression was chosen as the method for analysis to account for the effect of clustering within communities and by research assistant.

received a financial incentive was higher than in households that did not receive an incentive. A lottery with a one in eight probability of receiving an incentive had a similar effect on HIV testing as a fixed incentive of $2.</p><p id="para320">Uptake of HIV testing in households that received no incentive was low (20%) despite HIV testing being free of charge. This could be because diagnostic HIV testing at the clinic was available during working hours only, and bringing children to the clinic for HIV testing necessitated caregivers taking time off work or looking after other children and possibly children missing school.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Diagnostic HIV testing was not done during the household visit because it could have affected participation in the prevalence survey, but dedicated research staff were available at the primary health-care clinics so that those attending for HIV testing did not have to wait in the routine clinic queue.</p><p id="para330">The use of incentives to increase HIV testing is grounded in two economic concepts related to decision making. First, an economic incentive might mitigate indirect costs of HIV testing incurred by clients, such as loss of income through time taken off work and transport costs. These could be an even larger cost consideration for a child who is likely to be economically dependent. Second, some individuals might display what is termed present-biased preferences of a behaviour. They place disproportionate emphasis on the immediate costs and benefits, such as economic burden or fear of a positive result compared with future costs and benefits.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Incentives might bring forward in time the benefits and sway the decision of the child, the caregiver, or both.</p><p id="para340">Incentives have been used for the completion of goal-directed activities such as hepatitis B vaccination, tuberculosis screening, and testing for sexually transmitted infections.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Several studies<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> have shown improved uptake of HIV testing by young people and first-time testers in sub-Saharan Africa. However, incentivised HIV testing in children and adolescents has never been investigated. Findings from a recent study<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> in Tanzania showed that incentivising universal HIV testing in adults with $1&#x000b7;30&#x02013;6&#x000b7;40 was highly cost-effective. The costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained was $70 for prevalent and $620 for incident HIV infections. However, HIV prevalence is generally lower in children and adolescents than in adults and therefore cannot be generalised to this age group. This might be off set partly by the fact that children and adolescents have more unlived life-years and are not at ongoing risk of being HIV infected until they become sexually active. HIV testing is therefore a one-off activity in childhood, which is particularly important because the sustainability of incentivisation strategies is of concern, particularly for enforcing long-term changes in health behaviours, such as adherence to ART.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p id="para350">In low-income settings, lotteries might be a more affordable strategy than fixed incentives. In our study, the proportion of participants in the lottery group who underwent HIV testing was almost three times the proportion of participants in the control group who had an HIV test, and the effect was similar to that of a fixed incentive. These findings are in contrast with results from studies investigating the effect of fixed financial incentives or lottery, or both, to enhance uptake of circumcision.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Fixed incentives increased uptake of circumcision, but lotteries had no or a non-significant effect.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Contextual factors need to be taken into account when designing an incentivisation strategy. Careful consideration is needed to determine the amount, type, and frequency of incentives and the probability of receiving an incentive.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> These factors affect both the likelihood of affecting the desired behaviour and enable autonomic decision making by the client.</p><p id="para360">Ethicists have raised concerns regarding coercion and equity when using incentives to promote healthy behaviour.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> In particular, when considering incentivisation of caregivers for health-related activities targeting their children, the potential of coercion of children from their caregivers should be considered. Lottery systems might be ethically less problematic because receipt of the incentive does not rely exclusively on displaying the desired behaviour but includes an element of chance. The use of lottery incentive systems to encourage HIV testing in the general population has been discussed in the national HIV testing campaign South African Right To Know.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref></p><p id="para370">The strengths of this study include an incentivisation strategy directed at caregivers who are the gatekeepers to children accessing health care, clear denominators, and a large sample size. We acknowledge several limitations. First, the trial was nested in a prevalence survey involving household visits. Whether the interaction between fieldworkers and household members and the information provided during these visits had any effect on the uptake of testing is unknown. Second, the number of households randomised to each trial arm were relatively balanced, but the number of households eligible to participate were not, which might have introduced selection bias. However, adjustments were made for the number of children per household to account for imbalance. Households randomised to not receive an incentive were more likely to indicate that they did not have a child in the target age group and therefore were ineligible. These households might have silently refused to participate but felt uncomfortable refusing openly. Thus the incentives might have increased the participation in the trial and uptake of testing. Household characteristics of the participating household were similar between the three groups except for the number of children in each household. This did not affect the effect estimate, as the outcome was measured on household level and adjusted for the number of children in a household. Third, children in the non-incentivised group might have tested without identifying themselves as trial participants, resulting in differential outcome misclassification and possibly overestimation of the effect. Fourth, as previously discussed, the effect of incentives is context-specific. Although the broad principle might be generalisable to other settings, the size of the effect is less likely to be.</p><p id="para380">UNAIDS has set ambitious 90-90-90 targets, whereby 90% of people living with HIV infection should be diagnosed, 90% of HIV-infected individuals should be receiving ART, and 90% of those receiving ART should be virologically suppressed by 2020.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> If achieved, this would lead to a 90% reduction in AIDS-related mortality and HIV incidence by 2030 and eliminate HIV as a public health threat. Reducing the burden of undiagnosed HIV is the crucial first step to realising the UNAIDS targets. Existing strategies are clearly inadequate to address the substantial burden of undiagnosed HIV infection in adolescents, and novel approaches will be necessary if the targets are to be met in this age group. Our findings show that incentives targeted at caregivers substantially improve HIV testing rates in adolescents. Looking forward, the cost-effectiveness of this approach must be studied, and careful thought must be given to the social and cultural context if strategies such as this are to be brought to scale.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="other" id="sbref10"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>UNAIDS</collab></person-group><article-title>2015 progress report on the global plan towards the elimination of new HIV infections among children and keeping their mothers alive</article-title><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/JC2774_2015ProgressReport_GlobalPlan_en.pdf" id="interrefs30">http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/JC2774_2015ProgressReport_GlobalPlan_en.pdf</ext-link><year>2015</year><comment>(accessed Aug 18, 2017).</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sbref20"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Staveteig</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Head</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name><name><surname>Bradley</surname><given-names>SEK</given-names></name><name><surname>Nybro</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><chapter-title>Demographic patterns of HIV testing uptake in sub-Saharan Africa.
