Potentially harmful treatments are administered to these vulnerable patients due to a lack of clear evidence. Newly available treatment that targets a key inflammatory pathway in acute gout attacks provides an opportunity to undertake the first-ever trial specifically looking treating people with kidney disease. This paper describes the protocol for a feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing anakinra, a novel interleukin-1 antagonist versus steroids in people with chronic kidney disease (ASGARD).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>ASGARD is a two-parallel group double-blind, double-dummy multicentre RCT comparing anakinra 100 mg, an interleukin-1 antagonist, subcutaneous for 5 days against intramuscular methylprednisolone 120 mg. The primary objective is to assess the feasibility of the trial design and procedures for a definitive RCT. The specific aims are: (1) test recruitment and retention rates and willingness to be randomised; (2) test eligibility criteria; (3) collect and analyse outcome data to inform sample and power calculations for a trial of efficacy; (4) collect economic data to inform a future economic evaluation estimating costs of treatment and (5) assess capacity of the project to scale up to a national multicentre trial. We will also gather qualitative insights from participants. It aims to recruit 32 patients with a 1:1 randomisation. Information from this feasibility study will help design a definitive trial and provide general information in designing acute gout studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The London-Central Ethics Committee approved the protocol. The results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and at scientific conferences.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>EudraCT No. 2015-001787-19, NCT/Clinicalstrials.gov No. NCT02578394, pre-results, WHO Universal Trials Reference No. U1111-1175-1977.

The overall incidence of acute gout attacks has been estimated to be approximately 2 per 1000 person-years.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> The prevalence of gout is increasing due to increasing prevalence of comorbid conditions that are associated with hyperuricaemia such as hypertension, obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes and chronic kidney disease.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref>
</p><p>In a UK study, approximately 89.4% of patients were treated for their acute attack with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS) which are well known to worsen kidney failure.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Secondary care data from the USA showed that up to 50% of acute gout patients had CKD and 40% were given contraindicated medications.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> This is similar to our experience where a review of inpatient acute gout care showed half of all patients with acute gout and kidney disease were given potentially harmful medications. Mismanagement of acute gout attacks in patient with kidney disease occurs as there is no firm evidence base for treating acute gout attacks in people with kidney disease.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</p><p>The lack of evidence in the literature for the use of conventional agents in patients with CKD is primarily because patients with CKD are excluded as NSAIDS are used as an active comparator in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Guidelines continue to suggest using colchicine with in patients with renal disease even with its toxicity profile and poor evidence base.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref> We now have an opportunity to conduct a trial using two agents that would not be expected to have adverse effects on renal function.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Treatment options for patient with acute gout attacks and CKD</title><p>NSAIDS have the largest evidence base for use in acute gout but are contraindicated in CKD as they can cause an acute kidney injury. They can also worsen heart failure, hypertension, liver failure and cause gastrointestinal bleeding.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 11</xref> Colchicine is an alternative anti-inflammatory agent, it has a narrow therapeutic index and a low-dose regime is advocated following findings in the high versus low dosing of oral colchicine for early acute gout flare (AGREE) trial. Even though this study excluded patients with moderate to severe kidney disease (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &#x0003c;60 mL/m<sup>3</sup>), 23% of patients on the low-dose treatment still experienced diarrhoea.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Diarrhoea is more common in patients with CKD, they are also more likely to have drug accumulation and serious side effects from toxicity such as bone marrow failure, rhabdomyolysis, pancreatitis and myopathy.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</p><p>Glucocorticoids are an effective treatment with some evidence for use in patients with CKD from older trials. Triamcinolone, a long-acting synthetic corticosteroid, was shown to be as effective as adrenocorticotrophic hormone, a hormone that increases endogenous cortisol secretion.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A more recent double-blind randomised controlled study<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> showed that prednisolone 35&#x02009;mg for 5 days was not inferior to naproxen for acute gout attacks, although patients with moderate to severe renal impairment were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Interleukin-1 inhibitors</title><p>Interleukin-1 (IL-1) signalling has been shown to play a key role in gout-associated inflammation<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> and targeted therapy is now available. Two agents of IL-1 have been used in RCTs. Rilonocept, an IL-1 decoy receptor, has been shown to be efficacious in reducing acute flares during the initiation of urate lowering therapy,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> but no added benefit was obtained for the treatment of acute gout when it was used in addition to an NSAID.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Canakinumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL-1 beta, showed efficacy preventing acute flares during the initiation of urate-lowering therapy<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and for acute gout in patients with difficult disease or contraindication to colchicine or NSAIDs.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;22</xref> It was associated with increased adverse events after a single injection<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> which was felt in part due to its prolonged action which can be for many weeks.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> This study will use anakinra (Kineret), an IL-1 receptor antagonist that competes with IL-1beta for its receptor. A pilot study of its use in gout showed prompt resolution of symptoms in patients treated with anakinra,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> including in three patients with renal impairment. There have been further reports of the use of anakinra in difficult to treat cases showing good efficacy, with most patients having a good response within 24 hours.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;31</xref>
</p><p>Anakinra has a good pharmacokinetic profile with a shorter duration of action, accumulation can occur in severe renal failure,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and this had been linked to an increased risk of infection in one case report.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> The dose of a daily 100&#x02009;mg has been used in studies looking at treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (usually between 50&#x02009;and 150&#x02009;mg), and it was well tolerated for up to 3&#x02009;years.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33&#x02013;37</xref> The licensed use of anakinra is for Cryopryin Associated Periodic Syndrome where dosing is 3&#x02013;4&#x02009;mg/kg in severe disease (doses up to 800&#x02009;mg).<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> The rationale for the duration of treatment use of 100&#x02009;mg subcutaneous for 5 days come from emerging data where anakinra has been used to treat acute gout with good efficacy and in patients with CKD without too many adverse events.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25&#x02013;29</xref> Some reports vary between 3 to 5 days but most use 5 days&#x02019; duration of treatment to ensure adequate response in all patients, including our own experience.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> We have intentionally avoided using anakinra in patients with severe renal failure (GFR &#x0003c;30 mL/min/1.73&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup>) although it has been used safely in patient on haemodialysis using an alternate regime,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> and we have some experience of this in our centre.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Anakinra is much cheaper compared with canakinumab (&#x000a3;131.15 versus &#x000a3;9927.90 for a course of treatment), which has been given a license in the UK for use in difficult to treat gout.</p><p>Safety experience stem mainly from studies in rheumatoid arthritis where patients were on concurrent immunosuppressive treatment and the duration of treatment was prolonged (up to 6&#x02009;months). A slightly higher risk of infection (2%) and neutropaenia was noted. We do not anticipate these issues as the treatment time for acute gout will be short, 5&#x02009;days versus many months, and we feel the risk of infection should be much less. We are excluding people with concurrent immunosuppressive treatment and will exclude people with serious infection. There are some data of the use of anakinra in the setting of an active infection from the first clinical trial where it was used to treat people with severe septicaemia and those who received anakinra were not worse off.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> There are also reports of the use of anakinra for acute gout for hospitalised inpatients with active infections and multiple comorbidities.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;29</xref> There was one case report of neutropaenia in one patient with a kidney transplant with severe renal impairment.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Blood counts will be checked at the end of treatment at day 5 and participants will also be assessed for infection face to face on day 2, day 7 and 8 weeks, and by telephone contact on day 3, day 4 and day 5. Participants will be asked to stop treatment if serious infection develops.</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Methylprednisolone</title><p>Methylprednisolone acetate is one of the most commonly used long-acting intramuscular agent in the UK, we have shown this in our region,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> and it is equivalent to Triamcinolone in other joint conditions.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>
</p><p>We are using methylprednisolone 120&#x02009;mg given by intramuscular injection which is as efficacious as oral steroids with a lower cumulative dose (120&#x02009;mg vs 175 mg) in other rheumatology conditions, and this is equivalent to the dose of oral prednisolone used in the trial by Janssens <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> (35&#x02009;mg for 5 days). This well-designed double-blind randomised controlled study showed that prednisolone 35&#x02009;mg for 5 days was not inferior to naproxen. The rate of side effects even with short-term steroid treatment in acute gout is unknown. Our study may help establish steroids, especially intramuscular methylprednisolone which has limited evidence base, as a potential safe, cheap and readily available treatment for acute gout in patients with renal disease. If the initial results show equivalent efficacy between the two treatment arms, then we could go on to establish steroids as the standard treatment and make considerable savings.</p><p>Our use is only as a one-off injection (as is commonly done in routine practice), and we do not anticipate long-term complications. Short term side-effects we may encounter are uncontrolled blood sugars in people with diabetes and worsening oedema in people with heart failure and kidney failure. The latter should occur less with methylprednisolone which is associated with less mineralocorticoid effect than other steroids (eg, prednisolone). The placebo equivalent for the methylprednisolone will be Lipofundin, a lipid emulsion commonly used in parenteral nutrition but has been use as a placebo agent in other trial using steroids.</p></sec><sec id="s1e"><title>Objectives</title><sec id="s1e1"><title>Primary objective</title><p>The primary objective of interleukin-1 antagonist versus steroids in people with chronic kidney disease (ASGARD) is to assess the feasibility of the trial design and procedures for a definitive RCT.

</p></supplementary-material><p>Our hospital serves a population of 350&#x02009;000 and had an average of 47 patients per year over the last 4&#x02009;years with approximately 50% of patients having chronic kidney disease (ie, 23 patients per year). Enrolment is for 15 months from six centres, we will only recruit patients in working hours, that is, 9:00&#x02013;17:00, it would be logistically difficult to avoid delays to treatment if participants present out of hours and face-to-face assessments cannot be done at weekends due to lack of research infrastructure in most small to medium-sized hospitals. All hospitals should be able to have pharmacy support to provide preparation and recording of treatment administered.</p><p>Potential participants would hopefully be fully aware of study if a letter of invitation was already sent to them. Otherwise, potential participants can have up to 24 hours to decide if they wish to take part in the study. Analgesia that is listed can be used if required; however, baseline assessments can only occur 4&#x02009;hours after administration of last dose, that is, before the administration of the next dose. Treatment cannot be withheld during this period and exclusion criteria will be applied if duration of attack is longer than accepted or if contraindicatory medication is administered.</p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Allocation</title><sec id="s2l1"><title>Sequence generation</title><p>Enrolled patients will undergo 1:1 randomisation in blocks of four. Randomisation will be undertaken using an internet-based randomisation system within Anglia Ruskin Clinical Trial Unit (ARCTU). The ARCTU uses the Trans European Network Alea (TENALEA) system provided by the Trans European Network for Clinical Trial Service.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2m"><title>Concealment mechanism</title><p>Once a patient has consented to take part in the trial, the designated staff will log in to the TENALEA web page to confirm eligibility and a random allocation will be sent to pharmacy. All investigators involved with the trial will be blinded to treatment. Patients will not be informed of their assigned treatment during the study. Pharmacy will keep a record of allocated treatment arms in the event emergency unblinding is required.</p></sec><sec id="s2n"><title>Implementation</title><p>Anakinra and its placebo will be supplied by the manufacturer. Intramuscular methylprednisolone and its placebo (Lipofundin) will be prepared by a research team member not involved with the study.</p><p>Study labels will be provided to preserve blinding. Anakinra and its equivalent placebo will be provided by the manufacturer, once allocation is known, pharmacy will use label stating &#x02018;Anakinra or placebo&#x02019; using standard operating procedure. Five individual syringes labelled 1 to 5 will be placed individual transparent syringe holders and packed for dispensing with a local pharmacy label. For intramuscular methylprednisolone (Depo-Medrone) and Lipofundin, a member of the study team not involved with the trial will draw the treatment and label with a study label stating &#x02018;Depomedrone or placebo,&#x02019; using a standard operating procedure.</p></sec><sec id="s2o"><title>Blinding</title><p>All trial investigators will be blinded to the intervention. Pharmacy will keep a record of treatments administrated. All trial participants, care providers and outcome assessors will be blinded to the treatment. Each treatment has its equivalent placebo to ensure blinding in maintained throughout study.</p></sec><sec id="s2p"><title>Emergency unblinding</title><p>The treatment code for a participant can be broken by any clinician either directly or via contact of the principal investigator, allocation lists are available to the site pharmacy will provide 24-hour cover. Failing that, the central pharmacy can access allocation list. Where possible the local investigator should aim to discuss the need for unblinding with the coordinating investigator and blind should be endeavoured to be preserved to relevant research staff (data collection, analysis and interpretation). The coordinating investigator is responsible for pharmacovigilance management and reporting.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Methods: data collection, management, analysis</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Data collection methods</title><p>Data collection will be by electronic clinical research forms (eCRF), these can be printed out if required for convenience of data collection (and act as source document) and then data inputted onto eCRF. Data can also be inputted direct onto eCRF and the completed eCRF can be printed out to act as source documents.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Training plans</title><p>Study investigators must be aware of the classification criteria for gout. For the purposes of this study, each principal investigator will be asked to go through a presentation that will be available online and asked to attend study days where concerns will be raised.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Quality control of data and results</title><p>Entered data will continuously reviewed by the data manager and any gaps in data will be fed back to the centre trial team. Routine blood results will be taken from the National Health Service (NHS) system. Samples for additional testing will be transported as per standard operating protocol to the co-ordinating centre.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Participant retention and withdrawal</title><p>Enrolled participants will be contacted daily (weekdays) by the study team for a week. Participants may withdraw from the study for any reason at any time. The investigator may also withdraw participants from the study to protect their safety and/or if they are unwilling or unable to comply with required study procedures after discussion with the chief investigator. Participants who ask to stop study treatment, become pregnant or develop a serious infection (necessitating intravenous antibiotic treatment and hospital admission) should continue to attend all follow-up study. Participants who withdraw their consent at any point will be asked of their wish regarding the use of data collected up to the point of withdrawal. Participants who do not attend follow-up assessment after site staff have attempted to contact the patient at least twice, for example, by telephone may be considered for withdrawal, the data already collected for them may be used and therefore needs returning in the usual manner. The PI responsible for a patient may choose to withdraw a patient from a trial for appropriate medical reasons, be they individual adverse events or new information gained about a treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Data management</title><p>Information from the patient diary and functional assessments will be entered onto an eCRF. Data will be entered as it is possible to do so that is, day 1, day 2, day 7 and 2 months. Referential data rules, valid values and range checks will be support by the data entry software. The data manager will review the data being sent at regular intervals and report back to the centre if there is any discrepancy. All forms, hard drives and storage devices related to the study will be kept in locked cabinets. Access to the study data will be restricted; a password system will be used to control access. Data will be stored at MACRO database.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Study status reports</title><p>Regular updates of the study will be sent to the principle investigators via email and will be posted on the study website.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The sample size will be too small for estimates to have adequate precision, and some methods will not be technically possible for some patterns of missing values. To make use of data obtained, comparison of groups with the use of time-to-event (&#x02018;survival&#x02019;) analysis will be undertaken where relevant. Comparison of continuous outcome measures will be undertaken with repeated measures analysis of variance with permutation tests. Two-sample comparisons of means will be by the two-sample permutation test.

We will collect relevant data on resource use (costs) and health-related quality of life to inform subsequent large-scale study. Key drivers of costs, resource allocation and scalability will be determined.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3i"><title>Qualitative analysis</title><p>Twelve participants who give their specific informed consent for participation in the qualitative study will selected for an interview around their last 8&#x02009;week follow-up. The interview will cover areas such as how participants became involved with the trial, the information that was provided for them, the process of obtaining informed consent and any areas that felt was not adequately covered or could have been undertaken differently.</p></sec><sec id="s3j"><title>Data monitoring</title><p>The Trial Steering Committee will consist of the chief investigator (CI), trial coordinator, funding coapplicants and two members of patient group will bring independent representation. The TSC will take on some aspects of pharmacovigilance. There will be no data monitoring committee as this is a small feasibility study with a short duration and short follow-up, and pharmacovigilance is a component of the study. The Trial Management Group (TMG) will consist of the CI, funding coapplicants, representative of the clinical trials units including trial coordinator, data manager and statistician. They should meet every 2&#x02009;months to ensure all practical details of the trial are progressing well and adequate targets are met. The patient group consists of patients (and family) from Southend University hospital with chronic kidney disease and suffer from acute gout attacks.</p></sec><sec id="s3k"><title>Interim analysis</title><p>There will be no interim analysis as this is a feasibility study, the study procedures will be regularly reviewed at the trial steering committee.</p></sec><sec id="s3l"><title>Harms</title><p>Reporting of adverse events will start at the point of consent and reporting for adverse reaction starts at first IMP dose until 7 days&#x02019; post-treatment. At each contact with the subject during the treatment period, the investigator must seek information on adverse events by specific questioning and, as appropriate, by examination. All clearly related signs, symptoms and abnormal diagnostic procedures should be recorded using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) V.4.0 event terms and grading. The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution or stabilisation.</p><p>Reporting will follow local operating procedure and study protocol with oversight from the coordinating centre. Non-serious adverse events or reactions will be recorded in the study file with follow-up; and reported for review by the coordinating investigator within a month. All SAEs*/ suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSARs) must be recorded on the SAE form/adverse event clinical research form (AECRF) form and faxed to the sponsor within 24&#x02009;hours of the research staff becoming aware of the event. Any change of condition or other follow-up information should be faxed to the sponsor as soon as it is available or at least within 24&#x02009;hours of the information becoming available. Events will be followed up until the event has resolved or a final outcome has been reached. All SAEs assigned by the PI or coordinating investigator as both suspected to be related to IMP treatment and unexpected will be classified as SUSARs and will be subject to expedited reporting to the Research Ethics Committee and Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The CI will complete the Council for International Organisations of Medical Sciences form and if warranted, an investigator alert may be issued, to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same drug (or therapy) that this serious adverse event has been reported.</p><p>Potential events/reactions reported with anakinra consist of neutropaenia, infection and less serious ones consist of injection site reactions such as erythema, pruritus and rash. Potential events/reactions with steroid treatment consist of worsening hypertension, blood sugar reading/uncontrolled diabetes and clinical signs of fluid retention. Pre-existing conditions should not be reported as AE unless the condition worsens by at least CTCAE grade during trial. The condition must be reported in the pretreatment section of the eCRF, if symptomatic at the time of entry or under concurrent medical conditions if asymptomatic. Given the potential of clinical events related to underlying comorbid disease burden of potential participants, events that are recognised and expected complications of the condition are exempt from normal reporting procedure, unless they are of an unexpected severity. Common expected events in these patients may consist of worsening complications of chronic kidney disease, heart failure, hypertension, diabetes complications, underlying cardiac disease with complications such as ACS, arrhythmia, hypotension, tachycardia and worsening oedema. Other exceptions to (serious) adverse events SAEs or serious adverse reactions (SARs) reporting consist of routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not associated with any deterioration in condition, associated with any deterioration in condition, for example, preplanned hip replacement operation which does not lead to further complications, any admission to hospital or other institution for general care where there was no deterioration in condition, treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of serious as given above and not resulting in hospital admission, any death or hospitalisation due to fall or fracture, any death or hospitalisation due to exacerbation of an existing medical comorbid condition.</p></sec><sec id="s3m"><title>Auditing</title><p>The study will be subject to monitoring, inspection and audit by Anglia Ruskin Clinical Trials Unit, Southend University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust acting as the Sponsor and other regulatory bodies to ensure adherence to Good Clinical Practice (GCP).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study will be conducted in accordance with the principles of GCP.
