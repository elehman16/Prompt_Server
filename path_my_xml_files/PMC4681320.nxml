These patients may have underlying dysmotility; therefore, targeting gastric motor dysfunction in addition to acid inhibition may represent a new therapeutic avenue.

It stimulates esophageal and gastrointestinal motility, and accelerates transit by enhancing the physiological release of acetylcholine from myenteric neurons. Elevated local acetylcholine levels increase esophageal peristalsis, accelerate gastric emptying, increase gastro-esophageal barrier function, stimulate gastrointestinal motility, and improve gastroduodenal coordination.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Other 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor agonists have also been shown to have stimulating effects on esophageal motility, LES pressure, and gastric emptying, with the potential to improve symptoms in patients with GERD.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, these drugs have been withdrawn owing to cardiovascular safety concerns, probably related to lack of 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor selectivity.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>The main aim of this study was to assess the effect of revexepride 0.5 mg on reflux parameters in patients with GERD who had persistent typical reflux symptoms despite treatment with a PPI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Men and non-pregnant women aged 18&#x02013;70 years were included in the study if they had at least a 6-month history of reflux symptoms (heartburn and/or regurgitation), and had been on stable treatment with a PPI (a minimum of a labeled dose) for at least the past 6 weeks as determined at the screening visit. Patients were required to have heartburn and/or regurgitation, of at least moderate severity, at a mean frequency of &#x02265;3 days per week during the run-in period, as assessed by twice-daily completion of a diary. Patients also had to have at least 25 liquid-containing reflux events in 24 h at baseline pH/impedance monitoring, performed while the patient was taking a PPI. The criterion of at least 25 liquid-containing reflux events per 24 h is based on this being the median value previously reported in patients who had persistent reflux symptoms despite treatment with a PPI.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> An endoscopy within the past 5 years was required to confirm the absence of reflux esophagitis grade C or D (according to the Los Angeles classification).<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Patients were excluded if they had a history of: long segment (&#x0003e;3 cm) Barrett's esophagus; a large (&#x0003e;3 cm) hiatus hernia; fundoplication; an endoscopic antireflux procedure; previous major gastrointestinal surgery; a severe esophageal motility disorder (e.g., scleroderma, achalasia, nutcracker esophagus); a structural abnormality or disease of the gastrointestinal tract; or vomiting more than once per week. In addition, patients were excluded if they had a body mass index (BMI) &#x02265;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> Prohibited medications were: CYP3A4 inhibitors; drugs known to prolong the QT interval; drugs that affect gastrointestinal motility, including opioids and prokinetic agents other than the study drug; and other agents used to treat GERD, such as H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists and antacids. Additional exclusion criteria were: a history of cardiovascular disease (including prolonged QT interval based on electrocardiogram at screening); thyrotoxicosis; psychiatric disease; clinically significant abnormalities at screening (by physical examination or in blood hematology or biochemistry tests); or any other disease or abnormalities which, in the opinion of the investigators, would compromise the study or the well-being of the patient.</p><p>Patient selection was based on an automated local analysis. All participants provided written consent before the initiation of study-related activities, and the study was carried out in accordance with local ethical and legal requirements and the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial design</title><p>This was a 4-week, phase II, exploratory, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study of revexepride in patients who had reflux symptoms for a minimum of 6 months that persisted despite being on a stable PPI regimen for at least 6 weeks (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">http://ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: NCT01370863). The objectives of the study were to determine: (i) the pharmacodynamic effect of revexepride on parameters derived from pH/multichannel intraluminal impedance monitoring (pH/impedance); (ii) the effect of revexepride on reflux symptoms; and (iii) the safety and tolerability of the drug.</p><p>The study was carried out at 14 sites across six European countries: Belgium, France, Germany, Great Britain, The Netherlands, and Switzerland. After an initial screening visit, participants underwent a run-in phase of 14 days to establish their symptom frequency and adherence to PPI treatment. For participants who had been taking prohibited medications that were stopped at screening, there was an additional 7-day washout period before the run-in period.</p><p>At baseline, patients eligible for inclusion in the study were randomized 1 : 1 to receive either revexepride 0.5 mg or placebo to be taken three times daily for 4 weeks. The revexepride dose corresponds well to the optimal dose derived from available preclinical animal data (unpublished data). In addition, patients continued on their stable PPI treatment regimen (maintained the same dose and type of PPI during the study). PPI compliance was verified by patients' daily e-diary records. Revexepride was taken 30 min before breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Administration in relation to meals is beneficial because meals provoke transient LES relaxations, which causes most reflux episodes.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The randomization was generated using a central interactive web-based/voice response system that applied a minimization algorithm to ensure an approximate 1 : 1 balance between the two study arms. Participants were allowed to take antacid rescue medication (Rennie&#x000ae;, Bayer, Bladel, the Netherlands) up to three times daily, except during the pH/impedance monitoring periods. Assessments were performed at the baseline visit and after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. The presence of <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> was assessed at baseline based on medical history. The presence and grade of reflux esophagitis was determined by evaluation of endoscopic reports from the 5 years before randomization or, if unavailable, by an endoscopy.</p><p>Revexepride 0.5 mg and placebo tablets were visually indistinguishable and provided in identical medication boxes. Implementation of a central randomization system ensured that the double-blind treatment was maintained.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><sec><title>pH/impedance monitoring</title><p>Twenty-four-hour pH/impedance moni-toring was performed at baseline and at day 28 while patients were on a PPI. A single-use pH/impedance catheter (ComforTec&#x000ae; Z/pH or Sleuth Multichannel Intraluminal Impedance [MII] ambulatory system, Sandhill Scientific, Highlands Ranch, CO, USA, or Ohmega ambulatory system, Medical Measurement Systems [MMS], Enschede, The Netherlands, depending on the study center) was passed transnasally under topical anesthesia and the esophageal pH electrode positioned 5 cm above the LES. The same monitoring system and catheter were used for the same individual at both baseline and day 28. System-specific standard precalibration procedures were conducted accordingly. For the duration of the two 24-h ambulatory pH/impedance monitoring periods, each patient was instructed to eat similar meals at regular times between the two pH/impedance assessment visits, not to eat between meals, not to consume acidic drinks or excessive amounts of alcohol- or quinine-containing beverages, and not to lie down, except at bedtime. Participants were instructed not to eat or drink from 22:00 hours the night before each pH/impedance monitoring period. During both of the pH/impedance monitoring periods, no strenuous activities were allowed and patients were asked to record the onset of heartburn, regurgitation, or other symptoms. These records were used to assess symptom association with reflux events. The pH/impedance measurements were analyzed by 24-h period, and by recumbent (nocturnal) and upright (diurnal) periods, as well as by the postprandial (defined as 4 h after eating any meal) and postprandial breakfast (defined as 4 h after eating breakfast) periods. In each center, investigators analyzed impedance tracings to confirm patient's inclusion either manually or by using automatic analysis software. This was the standard automated analysis available on the local pH-impedance software at each study site. A central reader was employed to standardize the evaluation of the pH/impedance data.</p><p>The three primary pharmacodynamic endpoints of the study, assessed by prespecified <italic>post hoc</italic> central reading of the 24-h pH/impedance monitoring records, were: (i) the number of liquid-containing reflux events; (ii) the mean proximal extent of all liquid-containing reflux events; and (iii) the mean bolus clearance time of all liquid-containing reflux events. In addition, 24-h pH/impedance monitoring allowed the evaluation of the following secondary endpoints: the number and percentage of reflux events categorized by acidity (acidic [pH &#x0003c;4], weakly acidic [pH 4&#x02013;7], or weakly alkaline [pH &#x0003e;7])<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>; composition of the reflux event (liquid, mixed, or gas); proximal extent &#x0003e;15 cm; acid clearance time; and impedance baseline levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Symptoms</title><p>Frequency and severity of heartburn and regurgitation were assessed using electronic diaries (e-diaries), which were completed twice daily (in the morning and evening), from screening until the final visit. In the morning, questions were asked relating to sleep disturbances due to reflux events and to heartburn and/or regurgitation symptoms when lying down. In the evening, heartburn and/or reflux symptoms that were experienced throughout the day were assessed. In addition, patients were asked about their drug intake (investigational product and PPI use) to estimate exposure and compliance.</p><p>Symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were also evaluated at baseline, week 2, and week 4 using the Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Symptom Severity index (PAGI-SYM) and Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Quality of Life (PAGI-QOL) questionnaires, both of which have a 2-week recall period. The PAGI-SYM and PAGI-QOL instruments have shown good validity in assessing symptoms and HRQoL in patients with upper gastrointestinal disorders.<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The PAGI-SYM consists of 20 questions about heartburn/regurgitation, fullness/early satiety, nausea/vomiting, bloating, upper abdominal pain, and lower abdominal pain; each item is graded on a 6-point Likert scale (none, very mild, mild, moderate, severe, very severe).<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The PAGI-QOL includes 30 items graded on a 6-point scale, in the following domains: daily activities, diet and food habits, psychological well-being and distress, clothing, and relationships.<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Symptom assessments were also performed during pH/impedance monitoring and the symptom association probability (SAP) was estimated at baseline and at day 28. The SAP indicates the statistical probability (by Fisher's exact test) of the association between symptoms and reflux episodes; a positive association is defined as a SAP greater than 95%.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Adverse events and safety</title><p>Adverse events (AEs) were recorded from signing of the informed consent form to the final visit. At baseline and final visit, vital signs (blood pressure and pulse) were measured and electrocardiography and clinical laboratory assessments (hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis) were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Safety, demographic, and other baseline patient characteristics were reported for the safety population, which was defined as all individuals randomized into the study who received at least one dose of the investigational product. The pharmacodynamic population was defined as all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the investigational product and who had both a baseline and a postbaseline pharmacodynamic assessment (i.e., 24-h pH/impedance monitoring). All pharmacodynamic and efficacy (symptoms and HRQoL) analyses were based on data from the pharmacodynamic population. The following three endpoints were selected as primary as these were considered to be equally important: number of liquid-containing reflux events, the proximal extent of these reflux events, and the bolus clearance time of these reflux events. The intended sample size for the study was 45 patients per treatment arm. Assuming a SD of 25,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and a difference of 14.9 in reflux events, this sample size would allow detection of significant differences with a 5% level of significance and with 80% power.<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> With this sample size, relevant effects could also be detected for the other two primary endpoints. To have 90 patients completing this study, the aim was to enroll 100 patients. Correction for multiplicity was not necessary; however, if a significant difference for only one of the three endpoints was required, a correction for multiplicity was applied.</p><p>Baseline characteristics and exposure data were summarized descriptively. Continuous endpoints were assessed using an <sc>ancova</sc> on the change from baseline, and included baseline value as a covariate as well as treatment group and country as factors. Least-squares (LS) mean changes from the models were presented. For the PAGI-SYM and PAGI-QOL questionnaires, a change in score of &#x02265;1 point was considered clinically meaningful.<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Inferential statistical analyses of treatment effects were performed using <sc>ancova</sc> as described above.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient characteristics and baseline demographics</title><p>This study was initiated in December 2010 and was terminated early, on 23 March 2012, because of recruitment difficulties and the findings of an interim analysis. This analysis showed that the variability in the number of reflux events was much larger than assumed for determination of the study sample size. This would have necessitated a substantial increase in study sample size and therefore the study was terminated. There were no safety concerns. Patients who had enrolled before 23 March 2012 were given the option to complete the study.</p><p>The patient disposition is presented in the supplementary online information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). A total of 67 patients were randomized (34 to revexepride, 33 to placebo) before study termination; 65 patients received at least one dose of investigational product and were therefore included in the safety population (34 revexepride, 31 placebo). One randomized patient was withdrawn from the study before receiving a dose of investigational product because not all of the inclusion criteria had been met, and one was withdrawn because of a non-treatment-emergent AE. Of the 65 patients in the safety population, 62 completed the study. One patient in the revexepride group discontinued the study owing to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; dizziness and headache), and two patients (one from each treatment group) discontinued because they chose not to undergo the second pH/impedance monitoring (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). There were 60 patients (31 revexepride, 29 placebo) included in the pharmacodynamic population.</p><p>Patient characteristics and baseline demographics for the safety population are presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>. The mean age was 44.8 years and just over half of participants were female (<italic>n</italic> = 36; 55.4%). Participants had a mean duration of reflux symptoms of 116.3 months (approximately 9.7 years).

In healthy volunteers, a maximum effect on gastric emptying was obtained with a 0.5 mg dose, which corresponds well to the optimal dose derived from available preclinical animal data (unpublished data). In this investigation, however, no consistent effect of revexepride 0.5 mg on the primary or secondary pharmacodynamic endpoints of gastro-esophageal reflux and reflux symptoms was recorded, compared with placebo.</p><p>For patients with persistent symptoms on PPI therapy, the relationship between symptoms and gastro-esophageal reflux, both acidic and non-acidic, can be evaluated more thoroughly with pH/impedance monitoring than with conventional pH monitoring.<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In this exploratory study, pH/impedance monitoring did not reveal a clear treatment effect of revexepride on acidic, weakly acidic, or alkaline reflux events of mixed, liquid, or gaseous composition. A high proximal extent of reflux (&#x02265;15 cm above the LES) and mixed gas/liquid reflux has been found to be strongly associated with the perception of clinical symptoms during reflux episodes.<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> No significant effect was detected on the proximal extent or duration of reflux, and no significant changes were observed when evaluating the overall relationship between reflux events and symptoms as assessed during pH/impedance monitoring, although revexepride did reduce the number of regurgitation events more than placebo during pH/impedance monitoring.</p><p>Regurgitation can be caused by esophageal dysmotility and volume reflux.<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In previous studies, a reduction in regurgitation has been attributed to the prokinetic effects of 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor agonists such as cisapride and tegaserod on esophageal function,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> supporting the proposal that prokinetic agents can be complementary to PPIs in regurgitation-predominant patients.<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> However, in the present study, while revexepride had an effect on regurgitation, no effect was observed on the putative underlying mechanism (proximal extension of reflux episodes), which suggests that, given the high data variability in this study, pH/impedance assessment may not have been sensitive enough to detect a difference in reflux events. Alternatively, the observed reduction in regurgitation episodes may be attributable to a change in patients' perception of these episodes. In support of such a mode of action, the 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor agonist tegaserod was reported to decrease esophageal mechanosensitivity in patients with functional heartburn.<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>In addition to the pharmacodynamic endpoints, the effect of revexepride 0.5 mg on reflux symptoms was also evaluated through the use of a symptom e-diary that was completed twice daily. There were no significant differences in treatment effects between the revexepride 0.5 mg and placebo groups for any symptom. This was consistent with the findings from the HRQoL and symptom assessments (PAGI-QOL and PAGI-SYM, respectively). These results are also consistent with the findings of previous studies that have demonstrated that other motility drugs such as the 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor agonist cisapride in patients with functional dyspepsia,<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and the reflux inhibitor lesogaberan in patients with GERD who are partially responsive to PPI therapy, have poor efficacy in treating symptoms.<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Although lesogaberan showed a significant effect on transient LES relaxations and reflux variables, these findings did not translate into meaningful symptom relief.</p><p>Our findings do not necessarily negate a potential benefit of treatment with revexepride 0.5 mg, particularly when considering the efficacy of the drug in accelerating gastric emptying in healthy volunteers and animal models that has been shown in previous trials (unpublished data). There are several potential study limitations that may have contributed to the lack of clear treatment effect. The relatively small number of patients in this study is a crucial limiting factor. The study was terminated without having reached the initial target of 45 patients per treatment arm because an interim analysis indicated that high variability in reflux events and symptoms would require recruitment of many more patients to demonstrate significant differences between the treatment and placebo groups. Despite attempts to reduce the variability in the pH/impedance data through standardization and the use of a central reader, statistical power remained an issue. Day-to-day variability in the number of reflux events and reflux-related symptoms may genuinely be high, but the picture may also be complicated by high inter- and intra-assessor variation in pH-impedance analyses.<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>The lack of a clear treatment effect with revexepride 0.5 mg three times daily compared with placebo may also reflect problems of identifying patients on acid-suppressive therapies with reflux symptoms that are related to persistent, weakly acidic reflux events or dysmotility, who could potentially improve with a prokinetic medication. An estimated 20% of patients with reflux symptoms have functional heartburn<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and this proportion is likely to be higher among those who have a partial response to PPI therapy.<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In an attempt to include patients with GERD in our study, participants were selected on the basis of the outcomes of 24-h pH/impedance monitoring and were required to have a minimum number of 25 liquid-containing reflux events in a 24-h period, together with symptoms of heartburn and/or regurgitation on at least 3 days a week. A positive SAP was not an inclusion criterion in this study. On one hand, this may have led to dilution of the patient population with individuals who have functional or non-reflux-related symptoms that are less likely to respond to antireflux treatment, making the detection of a significant treatment effect less probable.<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> On the other hand, given the lack of beneficial effects on reflux parameters, restricting inclusion to patients with a positive SAP most likely would not have changed the overall outcome of the study.</p><p>In the present trial, a relatively high proportion of patients (16.9%) reported no response to PPI treatment at baseline, which suggests that they might have had esophageal dysmotility or functional heartburn rather than GERD. In addition, benign physiological reflux events may occur which are generally not associated with pathological signs or symptoms.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Therefore, the persistent symptoms in the other 83.1% of patients who did at least partially respond to PPI may have been related to acid reflux or other pathology, such as dysmotility or esophageal hypersensitivity. Esophageal hypersensitivity is another factor contributing to persistent symptoms, and prokinetic action seems less likely to be effective for patients when this is a prominent underlying pathophysiological factor.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In addition, approximately 15% of patients reported that PPIs improved their symptoms &#x02018;very much&#x02019; or &#x02018;quite a bit&#x02019;; therefore, the potential positive effect of revexepride on symptom improvement from baseline in these patients may not have been as obvious if they had reported that PPIs did not improve their symptoms very much. The relatively low symptom severity (indicated by PAGI-SYM scores) at baseline in both placebo and revexepride treatment groups and potential psychosomatic effects may have also hampered the ability to detect a significant treatment effect on symptoms. Furthermore<italic>,</italic> the investigational dose of 0.5 mg and treatment duration (&#x0223c;26 days) might also have been suboptimal.</p><p>Overall, and consistent with previous clinical studies, revexepride 0.5 mg was well-tolerated. Although the number of AEs was higher than with placebo, most TEAEs were mild or moderate, and no serious TEAEs were observed. There were no clinically significant safety findings; the safety evaluations did not raise any concerns about the dose of revexepride administered in this study. The problems of identifying patients with GERD who have a partial response to PPIs in advance of treatment and the limitations of questionnaires targeting GERD parameters require further attention. Future clinical studies of revexepride and other prokinetics may be better directed at patients with symptoms that are clearly related to persistent weakly acidic reflux, hypotensive esophageal dysmotility, or slow gastric emptying (i.e., symptomatic dysfunction), as determined by appropriate physiological tests.</p><p>In conclusion, pH/impedance monitoring and symptom assessments did not reveal a consistent difference in primary or secondary pharmacodynamic endpoints between revexepride 0.5 mg three times daily and placebo in this exploratory study. Overall, revexepride 0.5 mg was well-tolerated and no safety concerns were identified.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Writing support was provided by Vivienne Stein-Rostaing of PharmaGenesis&#x02122; London and funded by Shire.</p></ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This study was funded in full by Shire-Movetis NV.</p></sec><sec><title>Disclosure</title><p>Jan Tack has provided scientific advice to Almirall, AstraZeneca, Cosucra, Danone, GI Dynamics, GlaxoSmithKline, Ironwood, Janssen, Menarini, Novartis, Rhythm, Shire, Takeda, Theravance, Tsumura, Will-Pharma, and Zeria, has received a research grant or support from Abbott, Alpro, Novartis, Sandhill Scientific, and Shire, and has served on speaker bureaus for Abbott, Almirall, AstraZeneca, Danone, Janssen, Menarini, MMS, Novartis, Shire, Takeda, and Zeria.
