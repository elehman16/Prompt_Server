Forty-five patients younger than 2 years with normal estimated glomerular filtration rate and scheduled to undergo routine gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of any organ were included and received a single intravenous injection of gadoterate meglumine (0.1 mmol/kg). To perform the population pharmacokinetics analysis, 3 blood samples per subject were drawn during 3 time windows at time points allocated by randomization.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Gadoterate meglumine concentrations were best fitted using a 2-compartmental model with linear elimination from central compartment. The median total clearance adjusted to body weight was estimated at 0.06 L/h per kg and increased with estimated glomerular filtration rate according to a power model. The median volume of distribution at steady state (V<sub>ss</sub>) adjusted to body weight was estimated at 0.047 L/kg. Estimated median terminal half-life (t<sub>1/2&#x003b2;</sub>) was 1.35 h, and the median systemic exposure (area under the curve) was 1591 &#x003bc;mol h/L. Efficacy was assessed by comparing precontrast +postcontrast images to precontrast images in a subset of 28 subjects who underwent an MRI examination of brain, spine, and associated tissues. A total of 28 lesions were identified and analyzed in 15 subjects with precontrast images versus 30 lesions in 16 subjects with precontrast + postcontrast images. Lesion visualization was improved with a mean (SD) increase in scores at subject level of 0.7 (1.0) for lesion border delineation, 0.9 (1.6) for internal morphology, and 3.1 (3.2) for contrast enhancement. Twenty-six adverse events occurred postinjection in 13 subjects (28.9%), including 3 serious reported in 1 subject (2.2%).

They behave as extracellular space markers and are administered by intravenous (IV) route at the usual dose of 0.1 mmol/kg of body weight (BW).<sup><xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> A GBCA was first used in 1984 in adults during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnosis of different types of malignant or nonmalignant tumors.<sup><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Currently, in both Europe and the United States, central nervous system (CNS) imaging accounts for approximately half of all doses of contrast agents used during MRI.<sup><xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The first report of pediatric use of GBCA-enhanced MRI was published in 1988 in children older than 2 years<sup><xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and in 1989 in children younger than 2 years,<sup><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> in both cases for detection of intracranial lesions. Gadolinium-based contrast agent&#x02013;enhanced MRI is now widely used in children for detection and follow-up of lesions in the CNS, that is, brain and spine, and associated tissues.<sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>Gadoteric acid, meglumine salt (forming gadoterate meglumine; DOTAREM, Guerbet, Roissy CdG, France) is a macrocyclic and ionic GBCA with very high stability.<sup><xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The first approved indication, contrast-enhanced MRI of the CNS, is the most widely used application. In more than 75 countries, gadoterate meglumine is approved for IV administration at a recommended dose of 0.1 mmol/kg of BW, without dose adjustment, in adult as well as in pediatric patients including the youngest younger than 2 years. In a total of 241 pediatric patients younger than 2 years included in 3 prospective clinical studies and 6 prospective postmarketing observational studies, a good level of efficacy and safety has been documented, consistent with those found for adult patients and pediatric patients older than 2 years.<sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In adults, gadoterate meglumine is rapidly distributed in blood and extracellular fluid after IV injection. It is quickly renally eliminated from plasma in subjects with normal renal function<sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>; urinary elimination is delayed in case of renal impairment.<sup><xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> In children younger than 2 years, with an ongoing maturation of renal function,<sup><xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> there are no pharmacokinetics data so far obtained after gadoterate meglumine administration. The aim of the current study was to document in that fragile population the PK profile of this GBCA, as well as its safety and efficacy. This study was a company-sponsored post-marketing requirement from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov">www.ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT02411201).</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>This was a phase IV, open-label, prospective, multicenter, international study conducted in 4 countries: Austria, France, Hungary, and Poland.

The population model was defined by 4 components: (1) the structural model component, which predicts the dependent variable (plasma concentrations) as a function of time, dose, and parameters; (2) the between-subject variance component; (3) the covariate model component; and (4) the residual error model component. To calculate pharmacokinetic parameters, concentrations below the limit of quantification (4% of the total concentration) were considered as missing for the analysis, which is referred as the M1 method described by Beal.<sup><xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p>The following pharmacokinetic parameters from plasma samples were determined from typical and individual gadoteric acid concentration-time profiles: area under the curve (AUC), rate constant of the terminal phase (&#x003b2;), elimination half-life (t<sub>&#x000bd;&#x003b2;</sub>), total clearance (CL; per subject and normalized for BW), and volume of distribution (Vd; per subject and normalized for BW). For CL and Vd, the significant covariables responsible for the variations of the parameters were studied. In addition, a simulation of plasma concentration at 10, 20, and 30 minutes postinjection (C<sub>10</sub>, C<sub>20</sub>, and C<sub>30</sub>) was done, and those values were compared to the same values in adults (derived from historical data in adult subjects). A PopPK analysis was performed based on the PK data collected in a previous study conducted in 2003 in 32 healthy adult subjects. Exposure to gadoteric acid in adults was then compared, through simulations, with that of pediatric subjects younger than 2 years at the standard dose of 0.1 mmol/kg. Results were summarized using descriptive statistics and represented graphically using box plots. For quantitative comparison with pediatric population, the proportion of pediatric subjects falling outside the adult 95% percentile interval was computed for distribution of concentrations and AUC. It must be noted that the adult and the pediatric models were built with nonstrictly comparable absolute values of circulating compound model: total gadolinium concentrations (obtained by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry) for adults and gadoteric acid concentrations (obtained by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry) for pediatrics. However, as gadoteric acid is a gadolinium macrocyclic chelate that is not metabolized in vivo, the concentrations of total gadolinium accurately represent that of gadoteric acid.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Subject Disposition, Baseline Characteristics, and Indications for Contrast-enhanced MRI</title><p>From March 3, 2015, to October 19, 2015, a total of 51 subjects were enrolled in 9 centers from 4 countries: 32 (62.7%) from 2 centers in Poland, 11 (21.6%) from 3 centers in Hungary, 5 (9.8%) from 3 centers in France, and 3 (5.9%) from 1 center in Austria.

All checks and validations supported the appropriateness of this model. As anticipated, CL was found to increase with eGFR value. Overall interindividual variability was limited, regardless of the parameters, and the residual variability was also limited.</p><p>Median BW adjusted PopPK estimated CL value was 0.06 L/h/kg whereas it was determined to be around 0.10 L/h/kg in healthy adults after gadoterate meglumine injection.<sup><xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> This lack of marked difference between typical values of CL between the study population and adults, although the level of eGFR was found to impact drug elimination, was ascribed to the fact that only a fraction of the study population (11/45, 24.4%) had an eGFR level of 100 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> or lower. However, the inclusion of eGFR as a covariate in the determination of CL in the PopPK model allows an accurate estimation of all individual PK parameters from younger than 1 week to 23 months.</p><p>The small volume of distribution V<sub>dss</sub> estimated in the study (0.0473 L/kg) may confirm the limited distribution of gadolinium to vascular compartment.</p><p>From this PK model, the median estimated t<sub>1/2&#x003b2;</sub> was 1.35 hours. It is similar to the values of 1.5 to 1.6 hours that were reported in adults after gadoterate meglumine injection<sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and 1.6 hours reported in children aged 0 to younger than 2 years who received gadobutrol.<sup><xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> These values were also close to those obtained in older pediatric patients who received either gadobutrol,<sup><xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> or the linear GBCA gadoversetamide,<sup><xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> and in healthy pediatric subjects after administration of gadoversetamide.<sup><xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup></p><p>Similarly, at a given dose of 0.1 mmol/kg, the median (range) AUC (&#x003bc;mol h/L) calculated in our study (1591 [981;2841]) was roughly in the same order of magnitude than the values reported after administration of gadoterate meglumine in adults (median not reported, mean &#x000b1; SD, 974 &#x000b1; 76)<sup><xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and after administration of gadobutrol in infants younger than 2 years [776 (544&#x02013;1470)],<sup><xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> children aged 2 to 17 years [999 (397, 2163)],<sup><xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> and in adults [1110 (724, 1956)].<sup><xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup></p><p>Concentrations of and exposures to gadoterate meglumine of children younger than 2 years were compared (<italic>a</italic>) between the different age groups of children and (<italic>b</italic>) with the concentrations and exposures of adults through simulations for a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg using the PopPK models.</p><p>The comparison of values of concentrations and of AUC between age groups in children did not show any clear differences, a result roughly in keeping with those published by Kunze et al<sup><xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> with gadobutrol in children aged 0 to younger than 2 years, the only difference in this publication being a slightly higher mean AUC in subjects aged 0 to 2 months compared with the AUC of subjects aged 2 months to younger than 2 years.</p><p>Body weight normalized CL and V<sub>dtotal</sub> estimated for adults were higher than the estimations for children. These simulations showed that concentrations in children at 10, 20, and 30 minutes after the injection were lower than those in adults, with ratios between adults and children varying from 1.8 to 1.5. Moreover, AUC in children were shown higher than those of adults, as a consequence of the lower clearance. These results were quite well related to the difference of renal activity, as expressed by GFR or cystacin C, for example, observed between children younger than 2 years and older children and adults.<sup><xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Considering that gadoterate meglumine is almost exclusively excreted unchanged in urine and that urinary excretion essentially consists in filtration, renal activity is the pivotal process of elimination of gadoterate meglumine and, thus, of its clearance. Renal activity is directly age related; therefore, the present results appeared in very good agreement with expected results based on PK characteristics of gadoterate meglumine. No dose adjustment appears to be needed in pediatric patients.</p><sec><title/><sec><title>Efficacy</title><p>The efficacy of gadoterate meglumine was evaluated by the on-site radiologist in 28 subjects who underwent gadoterate meglumine&#x02013;enhanced MRI examination of CNS. Precontrast + postcontrast images allowed improvement from precontrast images for lesion visualization (border delineation, internal morphology, and contrast enhancement) in this population. Precontrast + postcontrast images allowed to identify 2 lesions in 1 patient, which were not detected by precontrast images. The overall quality of images was considered &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; for all 28 subjects with precontrast + postcontrast images. This is consistent with results reported with gadoterate meglumine in 1631 children aged 0 to 17 years enrolled in SECURE, a prospective observational study: good to very good image quality was obtained for more than 98% of the pediatric patients and diagnosis could be established for 99.6% of the cases.<sup><xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> These results are also in keeping with the efficacy results obtained with gadobutrol in a similar population,<sup><xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> where contrast enhancement of lesions was assessed as good or excellent in 93.2% of the subjects, and border delineation and internal morphology of lesions were both rated good or excellent in 97.7% of the subjects in the combined MRI, compared with 75% and 61.4% of the subjects, respectively, in unenhanced MRI.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>In the present prospective study, 13 of 45 subjects (28.9%) experienced postinjection AEs, but only 1 subject (2.2%) experienced 1 AE considered related to gadoterate meglumine by the investigator (rash of moderate intensity, occurring on the day of administration). No AE was severe in intensity and all resolved. Serious postinjection AEs were reported for only 1 subject and were not considered related to gadoterate meglumine administration. This is comparable with what was observed in a similar population after administration of gadobutrol,<sup><xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> where 18 of 44 subjects (40.9%) experienced an AE, serious in 3 subjects but not study drug related, and 1 subject experienced an AE assessed as study drug related, of mild intensity. These figures are also consistent with the good safety profile of gadoterate meglumine in pediatric subjects reported from clinical studies, where 140 children aged 0 to 17 years were included<sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>: 9 patients (6.4%) experienced AEs, related to gadoterate meglumine for 6 patients (4.3%) and 1 patient experienced 2 severe AEs assessed as not related to gadoterate meglumine. More generally, as concerns immediate reactions, GBCAs are well tolerated by children, even better than by adults: in a retrospective study of 65,009 adults and 13,344 pediatric patients conducted over a 7-year period (2001&#x02013;2006), acute allergic-like reactions rates were documented in 52 patients after 54 injections: 48 reactions (0.07%) in 46 adult patients and 6 reactions (0.04%) in 6 pediatric patients.<sup><xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p><p>As regard to laboratory tests, no clinically significant changes were observed in mean values of measured blood parameters. This also holds true for mean values of eGFR, which remained globally stable throughout the study, but with a wide interindividual variability.</p><p>Although not addressed, because of the short-term follow-up of the present study primarily aimed at documenting PK profile of gadoterate meglumine, long-term safety is a growing concern not only in adults but also in children, especially the youngest ones. Two long-term complications, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) and brain retention of gadolinium, have been linked to repeated administration of some GBCAs. Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is a rare, but severe and occasionally fatal, condition with rapidly progressive skin thickening, flexion contractures of joints, and sometimes fibrosis of internal organs.<sup><xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> The prolonged exposure to gadolinium in adult patients with moderate or severe chronic kidney disease after administration of GBCAs with a linear structure is currently considered as a significant, although probably not exclusive, factor leading to the occurrence of NSF months to years later.<sup><xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Exceptional occurrences of NSF have been identified in children. When the type of GBCAs was recorded, none of these cases was observed after administration of a macrocyclic GBCA, but only after repeated injection of linear GBCA. When noted, their renal function was substantially altered.</p><p>The European Society of Urogenital Radiology made recommendations aimed at preventing NSF, including in the pediatric population.<sup><xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> In neonates, high-risk linear GBCAs (gadodiamide, gadopentetate dimeglumine, and gadoversetamide) are contraindicated, and in infants younger than 1 year, they should be used with caution; in both populations, medium-risk linear GBCAs (gadobenate dimeglumine, gadofosveset trisodium, and gadoxetatic acid) and low-risk macrocyclic GBCAs (gadobutrol, gadoterate meglumine, and gadoteridol) should be administered at the lowest possible dose in a single injection, with a washout period of 7 days between 2 GBCA-enhanced procedures. Some authors clearly advocate the use of macrocyclic GBCAs only in this fragile population.<sup><xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup></p><p>Similar to findings in adults, 2 pediatric case records<sup><xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> then 3 publications of pediatric series (including few infants &#x0003c;2 years)<sup><xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> have recently shown on unenhanced MRIs an increased brain SI after repeated administration of the linear GBCA gadopentetate dimeglumine. A recent retrospective study<sup><xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> conducted on 41 pediatric patients (3&#x02013;17 years) showed no increase in brain SI after serial injections of gadoterate meglumine, confirming in pediatric patients the findings reported after serial injections of macrocyclic GBCAs in adults. If multiple enhanced magnetic resonance examinations are nevertheless indicated, current knowledge suggests that it is safe to perform them with all 3 macrocyclic agents,<sup><xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> while awaiting the results of long-term research on this topic.</p><p>In NSF and brain retention of gadolinium, the progressive release of free gadolinium ion is considered as a key pathophysiological factor.<sup><xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> This phenomenon depends on the stability of GBCAs, determined by the molecular structure of their chelates: the weaker the stability, the higher the risk of release of gadolinium ion.<sup><xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Macrocyclic chelates such as gadoterate meglumine offer a strong binding to gadolinium ion and have a higher stability than the flexible, open chains of linear chelates.</p><p>Regarding the pharmacokinetics analysis, the limitation of the study could be the relatively small sample size and the sparse sample collection. However, using the modeling techniques, it was possible to draw robust estimates of gadoterate meglumine PK parameters in neonates. Another limitation is the use of only 1 reader for the images evaluation, but this was considered acceptable, the efficacy assessment being a secondary endpoint.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Using a PopPK approach, this study appropriately described the pharmacokinetic profile of gadoterate meglumine in newborns and infants younger than 2 years, with values of PK parameters close to those already observed in adults with the same dose of 0.1 mmol/kg BW, without the need for dose adjustment. The present study also demonstrated the good tolerance and safety of gadoterate meglumine, as well as its efficacy for contrast-enhanced MRI examination of CNS, in this population. Given the current data concerning GBCAs involved in the pathophysiology of NSF and gadolinium brain retention, and taking into account the high stability of its macrocyclic structure, gadoterate meglumine appears as one of the preferred GBCAs to be administered in this very young pediatric population for contrast-enhanced MRI.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank all investigators who contributed to this study: Wanda Furmaga-Jablonska (Poland), Gy&#x000f6;rgy Balla (Hungary), Istan Lazar (Hungary), G&#x000e1;bor Rudas (Hungary), Fran&#x000e7;ois Laurent (France), Gustavo Soto Ares (France), and Gerard Pillion and Elisabeth Darmon Kern for providing editorial support.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>Conflict of interest and source of funding: Authors Mario Scala, Meriam Koob, Mathieu Felices, and Elzbieta Jurkiewicz have no conflict of interest to declare.
