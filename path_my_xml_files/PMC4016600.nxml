Concepts such as shared decision making may contribute to high quality healthcare by supporting patients to make informed decisions together with their physicians.</p><p>A multi-component shared decision making programme on the prevention of heart attack in type 2 diabetes has been developed. It aims at improving the quality of decision-making by providing evidence-based patient information, enhancing patients&#x02019; knowledge, and supporting them to actively participate in decision-making. In this study the efficacy of the programme is evaluated in the setting of a diabetes clinic.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A single blinded randomised-controlled trial is conducted to compare the shared decision making programme with a control-intervention. The intervention consists of an evidence-based patient decision aid on the prevention of myocardial infarction and a corresponding counselling module provided by diabetes educators. Similar in duration and structure, the control-intervention targets nutrition, sports, and stress coping. A total of 154 patients between 40 and 69&#x000a0;years of age with type 2 diabetes and no previous diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease or stroke are enrolled and allocated either to the intervention or the control-intervention. Primary outcome measure is the patients&#x02019; knowledge on benefits and harms of heart attack prevention captured by a standardised knowledge test. Key secondary outcome measure is the achievement of treatment goals prioritised by the individual patient. Treatment goals refer to statin taking, HbA1c-, blood pressure levels and smoking status. Outcomes are assessed directly after the counselling and at 6&#x000a0;months follow-up. Analyses will be carried out on intention-to-treat basis. Concurrent qualitative methods are used to explore intervention fidelity and to gain insight into implementation processes.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Interventions to facilitate evidence-based shared decision making represent an innovative approach in diabetes care.

An array of behavioural directives, such as quitting smoking, increasing exercise, normalising weight, and adhering to monitoring, dietary and medication prescriptions is imposed on patients with type 2 diabetes. Evidence on efficacy of these measures is varying and some may even do more harm than good [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Patients frequently feel demotivated and overloaded by the plethora of medical prescriptions. This might contribute to poor long-term adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] even to the most effective preventative interventions such as blood pressure control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and use of statins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>International and national societies claim a &#x0201c;patient centred approach&#x0201d; such as shared decision making (SDM) in diabetes care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. SDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] implicates an &#x0201c;involvement of both the patient and the doctor, sharing of information by both parties, taking steps to build a consensus about the preferred treatment, and reaching an agreement about which treatment to implement&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. A prerequisite for an informed decision making process is evidence-based patient information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In Germany however, SDM has not yet been implemented in diabetes care. Current education and counselling programmes for patients with diabetes provide rather general information, without numerical and comparative risk information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Key objective of this project is to improve the quality of decision-making by enhancing patients&#x02019; understanding and supporting them to actively deliberate between the available treatment options. This approach is implicated by the theory of planned behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], according to which behaviour is influenced by attitudes, by subjective norms such as perceived physicians&#x02019; attitudes, and by perceived and actual individual behaviour control. Providing evidence-based information aims at strengthening behaviour control by resolving knowledge deficits. Information about probabilities of outcomes is tailored to individual risk to realign unrealistic expectations.</p><p>An informed shared decision making (ISDM) programme on the prevention of heart attack in type 2 diabetes has been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In terms of a complex intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], it includes a number of interdependent components that may interact with contextual factors such as the educational background of participants and the setting. Development and evaluation of these components encompassed theoretical and empirical groundwork focusing on in-depth understanding of contextual interactions and implementation processes. Details are published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Key component of the ISDM-programme is an evidence-based patient decision aid (DA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The DA comprises decision relevant information on the concept of benefits and harms of different preventative options, an individual risk assessment tool, and a guide to support the decision making process. A preliminary qualitative study with diabetes educators and patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] indicated good acceptance and suitability to support informed decision making. Implementation of the DA is considered as optimal within patient education curricula and counselling programmes. Therefore, a patient counselling module was developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] related to the DA (updated 08/2012) and based on current criteria of evidence-based patient information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In order to simplify implementation, duration and structure have been adapted to current patient education modules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The counselling module was piloted within the target group and iteratively optimised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In order to enable diabetes educators to successfully apply the counselling, a train-the-trainer module has been developed, consisting of a video with examples and instructions, and a structured training-session.</p><p>Since piloting of the components of the ISDM programme demonstrated feasibility and acceptance, evaluation of the efficacy of the programme in a randomised-controlled trial (RCT) is required prior to implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In addition, concurrent qualitative research is needed to monitor and to ensure reliability and validity of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>The reporting of this study follows current statements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>Primary objective is to investigate if the ISDM programme is superior to the control-intervention regarding patients&#x02019; knowledge and realistic expectations concerning benefits and harms of the available treatment options. Key secondary objective is to determine if patients in the ISDM group achieve their individual treatment goals better than patients in the control-group. Additional objectives are to assess if patients presenting high numeracy levels achieve better knowledge than patients presenting low numeracy, if social status correlates to the level of knowledge, and if patients with good knowledge achieve their treatment goals better than patients with poor knowledge.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>A parallel group, two-arm, single blinded, randomised-controlled, superiority trial with 6&#x000a0;months follow-up is conducted under high fidelity intervention conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] comparing the ISDM programme with a control-intervention. Concurrent qualitative methods are used to explore and promote intervention fidelity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and to achieve in-depth understanding of implementation processes.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting</title><p>Study site is the diabetes clinic at the Department for Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases of the Jena University Hospital, Germany. In this clinic, patients are followed by diabetes educators and physicians usually twice but at least once a year. Most patients have joined a structured treatment and teaching schedule within the disease management programme (DMP). Four diabetes educators guide, motivate, and coach the patients in individual and group counselling sessions. Integral to the multidisciplinary diabetes care team, the educators develop individual plans of care, provide on-going self-management support, and analyse and adapt diet-sheets and insulin dosages. Patient characteristics, diagnoses, laboratory parameters, and prescriptions are documented in an electronic patient record system (EPRS).</p></sec><sec><title>Eligibility and recruitment</title><p>Patients with type 2 diabetes between 40 and 69&#x000a0;years of age are eligible for enrolment if they have no previous diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease (ICD I20-I25) or stroke (ICD I63) and have participated in the DMP education programmes for patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients are eligible with HbA1c-values between 6 and 9%. This range of values is sensitive to patient participation in decision making, regarding micro-vascular prevention. Patients are excluded if they have proliferative retinopathy, chronic kidney disease stage 3 or higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], metastatic cancer, or are addicted to alcohol or cared by a legal guardian.</p><p>EPRS is screened for eligible patients (study flow Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

The used approach is innovative: Certified diabetes educators provide evidence-based patient information on heart attack risk and prevention, discuss the individual notion of that information, and initiate a shared decision making process. Patients are motivated to set individual goals choosing the treatment options most important to them.</p><p>The study is conducted in the context of a diabetes out-patient clinic, which allows high standardization to monitor and maintain intervention fidelity. Moreover, qualitative methods are used to explore processes and barriers of implementation. A corresponding cluster-RCT is planned to assess the effectiveness of the ISDM-programme in the setting of primary care-practices.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>DA: Decision aid; DMP: Disease management programme; EPRS: Electronic patient record system; ICD: International classification of diseases; ISDM: Informed shared decision making; RCT: Randomised controlled trial; SDM: Shared decision making.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors (SB, TH, JK, IM, UAM, TL and ML) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>This study protocol was carried out in collaboration between all authors.
