upper crossed syndrome to examine the effects of upper crossed syndrome on position
senses. [Subjects and Methods] A sample population of 60 subjects was randomly divided
into three groups of 20: a normal group, a mild group, a moderate group. A cervical range
of motion device was attached to the head of each subject using straps and the reposition
errors of cervical flexion, extension, right lateral flexion, left lateral flexion, right
rotation and left rotation were measured. [Results] The normal group showed smaller
reposition errors than the mild group and the mild group showed smaller reposition errors
than the moderate group but none of the differences among the three groups was
significant. [Conclusion] Reposition errors increased in the order of the normal, mild,
moderate group but the differences were not significant. In addition, the degree of the
subjects&#x02019; postural misalignment was higher in the moderate than in the mild group. These
results demonstrate that cervical spine position sense declines as postural misalignment
becomes more severe.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Upper crossed syndrome</kwd><kwd>Position sense</kwd><kwd>Reposition error</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Office workers or students who spend long periods in front of a computer or at a desk begin
to adopt a forward head posture, with the head forward of the spinal center line, when
maintaining a normal spinal posture becomes difficult while sitting for work<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. A forward head posture causes mechanical
stress on the neck. Due to the muscle imbalances resulting from the stress, some muscles are
inhibited and weakened and other muscles tend to lose tensility<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. This muscle imbalance leads to a vicious cycle that
includes bent shoulders, shoulder rises, and abnormal postures of the shoulder blades. The
vicious cycle also leads to weakening of the muscles below the neck, such as the rhomboid
muscles, the anterior serratus muscle, and the lower trapezius muscle, and hardening of the
antagonist muscles, such as the greater pectoral muscle, the upper trapezius muscle, and the
musculus levator scapulae, due to stiffeness. Janda defined this phenomenon as upper crossed
syndrome (UCS)<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Proprioceptive senses are the senses used to control the positions and motions of the trunk
and parts of the body in space<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Proprioceptive senses related to the spatial recognition of the head require not only
information from the vestibular organs and visual information, but also proprioceptive sense
information from the cervical spine<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Proprioceptive senses perform two important roles in the neck: they provide information on
posture and motion of the cervical spine to the central nervous system, and they provide
cervical reflexes for stability and protection of the cervical spine<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Pathology, injuries, muscle fatigue, and aging have been
reported as causes of damage to cervical spine positional senses, and recent studies have
reported that position sense declines in patients with damage to the cervical spine or who
complain of pain<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, the present study aimed to compare the reposition errors of subjects with upper
crossed syndrome to examine the effects of upper crossed syndrome on position sense.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>In the present study, lateral photos were taken of 200 undergraduate students of D
University. In total, 60 subjects (39 females, 21 males) were selected, based on the photos
and they were divided into three groups (normal, mild, moderate) of 20 subjects per group
based on the classification criteria of the experiment. None of the subjects had any
musculoskeletal system disease, pain, or neurologic symptoms, and all the subjects
voluntarily agreed to participate in this study after receiving sufficient explanation about
the study method and purpose. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Daegu
University. The subjects&#x02019; mean age was 22.3&#x000b1;0.33&#x02005;years, their mean heights were
166.20&#x000b1;1.43&#x02005;cm in the case of the normal group, 167.30&#x000b1;1.28&#x02005;cm in the case of the mild group
and 167.40&#x000b1;1.73&#x02005;cm in the case of the moderate group and their mean weights were
59.05&#x000b1;1.73&#x02005;kg in the case of the normal group, 62.70&#x000b1;2.24&#x02005;kg in the case of the mild group
and 59.60&#x000b1;2.31&#x02005;kg in the case of the moderate group.</p><p>All the subjects who participated in the experiments were instructed to sit on a chair with
a backrest, to position their ankle, knee, and hip joint at 90&#x000b0; and to face forward.</p><p>Photos were taken using smartphones to classify the degrees of the upper crossed syndrome,
and the photos were analyzed using Dartfish software (DFKOREA, Korea). The distances between
the lateral center line of the shoulder and the lateral center line of the ear were
measured, and those with the lateral center line of the shoulder positioned less than 1&#x02005;cm
forward from the lateral center line of the ear were classified as the normal group, those
with the lateral center line of the shoulder positioned 1&#x02013;2.5&#x02005;cm forward from the lateral
center line of the ear were classified as the mild upper crossed syndrome group, and those
with the lateral center line of the shoulder positioned 2.5&#x02013;5&#x02005;cm forward from the lateral
center line of the ear were classified as the moderate upper crossed syndrome group<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A cervical range of motion (C-ROM Basic, Performance Attainment Associates, USA) device was
used to measure joint position senses in the neck region. The C-ROM device was attached to
the head of each subject using straps, and the subject was instructed to wear an eye patch
to block visual information to place the head in the neutral position, and to freely move in
various directions to relieve tension. When joint position senses were measured, external
effects that might confuse the subject&#x02019;s proprioceptive information or cause sensory
fatigue, such as noises and skin irritation, were blocked. For the measurement, the C-ROM
device was put on the head of the subject, and the shoulders of the subject were fixed by
the experimenter so that the movements would not be affected by other parts of the trunk.
The experiment was conducted by instructing the subject to move the head to make a neck
angle of 30&#x000b0;, which is 60% of the normal range of motion (ROM) of the neck<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subject was instructed to maintain
the angle of 30&#x000b0; for three seconds in order to recognize the angle, return to the neutral
position and to make the angle of 30&#x000b0; again two times repeatedly without assistance, while
taking a rest for three seconds between measurements. Flexion was measured first followed by
extension, right lateral flexion, left lateral flexion, right rotation, and left
rotation.</p><p>To compare reposition errors among the three groups, differences from 30&#x000b0; as a reference
value, which is 60% of the full ROM, were measured as absolute values and compared using
one-way ANOVA and the least significant difference (LSD) was used for post-hoc comparisons.
The PASW statistics ver. 12.0 program was used for all statistical analyses with a
significance level of &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The subjects showed gradually bigger reposition errors in the order of the normal, the mild

to other subjects. In a study of biomechanical changes in the trunk among sitting postures,
Caneiro et al. reported that larger degrees of flexion of the dorsal spine and the lumbar
spine appeared in stooped postures than in upright postures<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the reason was that forward postures with the chin positioned
forward appear in stooped postures, putting the upper cervical spine into extension and the
lower cervical spine into flexion<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a
study that examined the effects of different sitting postures on neck proprioceptive senses,
Jung et al. reported that position senses were poorer in stooped postures than in normal
postures<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> and Lee found that subjects
with severe forward head postures and larger reposition errors had poorer neck position
senses<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of the present
study show that the mild group had smaller reposition errors than the moderate group but the
differences were not significant; also, the degree of the subjects&#x02019; postural misalignment
was higher in the moderate group than in the mild group. Therefore, cervical spine position
sense declined as postural misalignment became more severe. In a study of the relationship
between the habit of laterally bending the neck and position senses, Kim reported that
position senses declined in those who had incorrect postures<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, and Bolton stated that as the longus colli muscle, a deep neck
muscle, acts as a neck posture-maintaining muscle, proper neck postures are maintained
thanks to the information delivered from the muscle spindles located in the longus
colli<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kirsch and Garza noted that in
chronic neck pain patients, appropriate location information could not be provided due to
the atrophy of the longus colli muscle<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, from these results it can be inferred that if such inappropriate postures are
continuously maintained, the position senses of the cervical spine can decline further.</p><p>Jung et al. reported that the position of the head is recognized through appropriate
proprioceptive senses, and information for maintaining proper postures needs to be
continuously provided<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, in
relation to the postures of the cervical spine, habits to develop correct posture are
considered necessary to prevent the occurrence of damage or pain due to decline in position
sense.</p><p>Studies of the diverse causes of declines in neck position sense involving subjects from
many age groups are considered necessary.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Cailliet</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group>: Shoulder pain; 3rd ed.
