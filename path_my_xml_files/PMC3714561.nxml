BA or dextrose (placebo) (6.4&#x000a0;g&#x000a0;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was ingested for 4&#x000a0;weeks and 500&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> BM of SB or calcium carbonate (placebo) was ingested for 7&#x000a0;days during the 4th week. Before and after 4&#x000a0;weeks of supplementation, the athletes completed four 30-s upper-body Wingate tests, separated by 3&#x000a0;min. Blood lactate was determined at rest, immediately after and 5&#x000a0;min after the 4th exercise bout, with perceived exertion reported immediately after the 4th bout. BA and SB alone increased the total work done in +7 and 8&#x000a0;%, respectively. The co-ingestion resulted in an additive effect (+14&#x000a0;%, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05 vs. BA and SB alone). BA alone significantly improved mean power in the 2nd and 3rd bouts and tended to improve the 4th bout. SB alone significantly improved mean power in the 4th bout and tended to improve in the 2nd and 3rd bouts. BA+SB enhanced mean power in all four bouts. PL+PL did not elicit any alteration on mean and peak power. Post-exercise blood lactate increased with all treatments except with PL+PL. Only BA+SB resulted in lower ratings of perceived exertion (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05). Chronic BA and SB supplementation alone equally enhanced high-intensity intermittent upper-body performance in well-trained athletes.

During the exercise performed at intensities exceeding the capacity of aerobic metabolism to resynthesize ATP (Wallimann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2011</xref>), hydrogen cations (H<sup>+</sup>) are produced with most buffered by physico-chemical means or exported into the circulation. Nonetheless, the H<sup>+</sup> concentration may increase 10-fold, measured as a decrease in pH from ~7.1 to ~6.3 (Costill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1984</xref>). Intramuscular H<sup>+</sup> accumulation impairs energy transfer (Sutton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1981</xref>), calcium handling (Donaldson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1978</xref>) and cross-bridge cycling (Fabiato and Fabiato <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1978</xref>), thus limiting performance during high-intensity exercise. As a consequence, H<sup>+</sup> buffering is critical for delaying the onset of muscle fatigue and maintaining exercise performance and capacity.</p><p>Intramuscular H<sup>+</sup> is buffered through the intracellular buffers (e.g. phosphates and carnosine), extracellular buffers (e.g. bicarbonate) and dynamic buffering system (i.e. the transport of H<sup>+</sup> outside the cells). In theory, high-intensity exercise performance could be improved if any of these buffering systems were enhanced. Several investigations have shown that increased extracellular buffering capacity, achieved either via acute or chronic sodium bicarbonate (SB) ingestion, improves high-intensity exercise performance and capacity (Requena et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2005</xref>; Carr et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2011</xref>), which has been shown to be ergogenic in different sports, such as swimming (Lindh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008</xref>), judo (Artioli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2007</xref>) and boxing (Siegler and Hirscher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2010</xref>). Likewise, beta-alanine (BA) supplementation increases intramuscular carnosine levels, and subsequently increases intracellular H<sup>+</sup> buffering (Harris et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2006</xref>). The increased intracellular buffering capacity induced by carnosine augmentation has been related to performance enhancements in high-intensity exercise (Artioli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2010</xref>; Sale et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2010</xref>).</p><p>Given that both SB and BA are ergogenic supplements that exert their buffering effects in different compartments (i.e. outside and inside the muscle cells, respectively), it is conceivable that the combined use of these two supplements would have additive effects on high-intensity performance. In fact, two studies have addressed this issue (Sale et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref>; Bellinger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>), but the results are equivocal. Sale et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref>) demonstrated that BA, but not SB, significantly delayed time to exhaustion in the 110&#x000a0;% CCT test (i.e. cycling capacity test at 110&#x000a0;% of the maximum power); the addition of SB to BA elicited a further nonsignificant improvement in performance. In contrast, Bellinger et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>) reported no performance improvements in a 4-min cycling trial after 4&#x000a0;weeks of BA supplementation, but a significant improvement after SB ingestion and a negligible nonsignificant additive effect with the co-ingestion of the supplements.</p><p>It was argued that these conflicting results were due to differences in the training status of the participants. While Sale et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref>) examined physically active male participants; Bellinger et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>) assessed highly trained cyclists. The pre-existing high muscle buffering capacity in trained athletes might have hindered the ergogenic effect of the BA-induced elevation in muscle carnosine (Bellinger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>). Alternatively, one may argue that the characteristics of the physical tests might also explain the inability to clearly detect the beneficial effects of increased buffering capacity on performance. Knowingly, intermittent supra-maximal exercise promotes a considerably greater intramuscular acidosis than continuous high-intensity exercise (Hermansen and Osnes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1972</xref>; Belfry et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2012</xref>), probably because the former is more reliant on glycolytic ATP resynthesis (Belfry et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2012</xref>). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that intermittent exercise performance is more limited by muscle acidosis and, hence, more prone to be improved by increased buffering capacity. Not surprisingly, the ergogenic effects of induced alkalosis have been more evident in intermittent than in continuous high-intensity exercises (Costill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1984</xref>). To our knowledge, however, only four studies have examined the effects of BA supplementation on high-intensity intermittent performance thus far (Derave et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2007</xref>; Donovan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2012</xref>; Saunders et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2012</xref>; Smith-Ryan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2012</xref>), with conflicting results being observed. Similarly, the two currently available studies on the combined effects of BA and SB have also used continuous exercise to assess performance (Sale et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref>; Bellinger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>), which may partially explain the lack of significant effects.</p><p>In the present investigation, we aimed to further explore the ergogenic effects of BA, SB and the combination of both supplements on high-intensity performance, using an intermittent upper-body exercise as the performance assessment model. In order to minimize any possible interference of pre-existing elevated muscle buffering capacity on the efficacy of the supplements, only well-trained athletes were examined.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Forty non-vegetarian, non-smoking, well-trained, experienced judo (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;19) and jiu-jitsu (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;21) male competitors volunteered to participate in the study.

Here, we also provide further evidence supporting the efficacy of both SB and BA on high-intensity intermittent exercise performance. BA and SB taken individually elicited similar improvements in performance, and both supplements increased blood lactate. The intermittent high-intensity upper-body exercise protocol (e.g. the four-bout Wingate test used in this study) would seem a useful model to detect performance improvements promoted by nutritional strategies that increase buffering capacity.</p><p>A number of studies have previously demonstrated the ergogenic effects of SB on high-intensity short-term performance (for a review, see McNaughton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2008</xref>). Evidence indicates that SB is particularly effective in exercise involving multiple high-intensity bouts, as this model seems to result in a more prominent acidosis, being more limited by pHi reductions (Belfry et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2012</xref>). In the present study, SB ingestion over 7&#x000a0;days (i.e. PL+SB group) significantly increased exercise performance (i.e. total work done) by 8&#x000a0;%, corroborating the previously reported beneficial effects of SB on intermittent exercise performance and confirming that chronic supplementation elicits performance improvements that are similar to those shown with acute ingestion (Artioli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2010</xref>).</p><p>BA supplementation has been much less studied, with the first study on humans being published in 2006 (Harris et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2006</xref>). Since then, an increasing number of studies have examined the potential ergogenic effects of BA across a range of exercise (Stout et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2008</xref>; Sweeney et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2010</xref>; Sale et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref>; Jagim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2012</xref>; Smith-Ryan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2012</xref>) and sport-specific (Derave et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2007</xref>; Baguet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2010</xref>; Van Thienen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2009</xref>; Bellinger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>; Saunders et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2012</xref>) tests. Despite some conflicting results, a recent meta-analysis concluded that BA is effective in improving exercise capacity (Hobson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2012</xref>), but only four studies have assessed the effects of BA supplementation on high-intensity intermittent exercise performance (Derave et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2007</xref>; Donovan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2012</xref>; Saunders et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2012</xref>; Smith-Ryan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2012</xref>), a model of exercise that is likely to be most sensitive in detecting the ergogenic effects of beta-alanine in comparison to continuous exercise. In contrast to some studies using continuous exercise protocols, our data convincingly demonstrate that BA alone (i.e. BA+PL group) significantly enhances high-intensity intermittent performance (+7&#x000a0;%) in a manner very similar to SB. In fact, our data suggest that BA is just as effective as SB and that there is no superiority between them.</p><p>To date, only two studies have examined the additive ergogenic effects of BA and SB. While neither the Sale et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref>) nor Bellinger et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>) studies were able to detect a clear additive effect of the combined supplementation (although Sale et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref> did report 70&#x000a0;% probability of a meaningful effect), our data show that co-supplementation of BA and SB were more effective at increasing the total work done over the four bouts of exercise than these supplements taken individually. The main methodological difference between the present study and those by Sale et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref>) and Bellinger et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>) relate to the exercise protocol used to assess performance (i.e. upper-body high-intensity intermittent exercise in the current study vs. continuous single-bout high-intensity leg-exercises in previous studies (Sale et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref>; Bellinger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>), which may have accounted for the discrepant results. In fact, evidence indicates that multiple bouts of supra-maximal exercise results in higher muscle acidosis than continuous supra-maximal exercises (Hermansen and Osnes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1972</xref>; Belfry et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2012</xref>). Moreover, it was demonstrated that arm exercises were more sensitive to performance improvements induced by increased buffering capacity (via sodium bicarbonate ingestion) than leg exercises, possibly because the former leads to greater blood H<sup>+</sup> concentration (Robertson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1987</xref>). Therefore, one may assume that the exercise protocol used in our investigation was probably more sensitive than those used in previous studies (Sale et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref>; Bellinger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>) to detect the buffering effects promoted by the co-ingestion of SB and BA.</p><p>According to some authors (Bellinger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>), training status could play an important role in the ability to respond to BA supplementation, as the long-term high-volume high-intensity training regimens undertaken by athletes would result in elevated muscle buffering capacity, minimizing the relevance of BA-induced increases in muscle carnosine for performance. In the present investigation, however, we showed a positive effect of BA supplementation on performance in well-trained competitive judo and jiu-jitsu athletes. Knowingly, the glycolytic anaerobic demand of judo and jiu-jitsu is very pronounced (Franchini et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2011</xref>), likely inducing a high muscle buffering capacity as an adaptation to training. Despite the likely high muscle buffering capacity of our athletes, eight of the nine athletes in the BA+PL group responded positively to BA supplementation, suggesting that BA may improve physical capacity even in highly trained athletes. However, further studies should investigate to what extent training status can impact the magnitude of changes in performance following BA intake.</p><p>Increased post-exercise blood lactate concentration has been consistently reported after SB ingestion (McNaughton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2008</xref>), which is in accordance with our data. The proposed mechanisms underlying such a response include higher lactate production caused by less inhibited glycolytic enzymes (Sutton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1981</xref>) and higher lactate efflux caused by augmented MCT1 activity (Mainwood and Worsley-Brown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1975</xref>). Although it is conceivable that BA would produce similar effects, since the pHi would be similarly increased throughout the exercise, most studies have shown no effect of BA on blood lactate concentration (Derave et at. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2007</xref>; Baguet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2010</xref>; Jagim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2012</xref>; Sale et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref>; Saunders et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2012</xref>). In the present investigation, a significant increase in post-exercise lactate was shown, which might be attributed to the increased lactate production in the exercised muscles. This effect might be triggered by the lower intramuscular H<sup>+</sup> concentration, allowing a higher glycolytic flux and higher rate of glycogen usage. However, we must emphasize that there is no current data directly supporting this hypothesis and a more detailed mechanistic study is indeed necessary.</p><p>Another notable finding of our study is the attenuated rating of perceived exertion when BA and SB were co-ingested, but not when BA and SB were ingested alone. Previous studies have also reported no effect of SB on the rate of perceived exertion (Artioli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2007</xref>; Siegler and Hirscher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2010</xref>). It has been argued that the sensation of fatigue is influenced by several factors, such as metabolic, circulatory and psychochemical, changes that occur during exercise (Poulus et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1974</xref>). Therefore, the effects of reduced acidosis would be only one among many factors, minimizing the impact of any buffering agent on perceived exertion. However, one may speculate that the greater effect promoted by the combined BA and SB supplementation upon acidosis could have been sufficiently large to attenuate the sensation of fatigue to an extent that could have been perceived by the athletes in this study. Further studies involving buffering agents should test this hypothesis by measuring pHi along with rates of perceived exertion.</p><p>In this study, we were unable to perform muscle and blood analyses to confirm the efficacy of BA in increasing muscle carnosine and SB to increase blood bicarbonate. However, all human studies using 1.6&#x02013;6.4&#x000a0;g&#x000a0;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of BA for 4&#x000a0;weeks or longer have so far reported increases of &#x0003e;40&#x000a0;% in muscle carnosine (for a review, see Sale et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2010</xref>). Furthermore, there is evidence showing that the same SB supplementation protocol used in this investigation results in a significant increase in blood bicarbonate concentration and pH (McNaughton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1999</xref>). Therefore, the BA and SB supplementation protocols used in this study very likely promoted increased muscle carnosine and blood bicarbonate, respectively.</p><p>To conclude, chronic BA and SB supplementation alone equally enhance high-intensity intermittent upper-body performance in highly trained athletes. Interestingly, the combined BA and SB supplementation promotes a clear additive ergogenic effect. BA and SB, combined or not, resulted in elevated post-exercise blood lactate, and only the combination of BA and SB was capable of attenuating the rating of perceived exertion. Finally, the 4-bout upper-body Wingate test was shown to be useful in detecting changes in performance induced by nutritional buffering agents.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Gabriel C Tobias and Guilherme G Artioli are supported by Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo &#x000e0; Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP-grants 2010/12302-3 and 2011/17059-2).
