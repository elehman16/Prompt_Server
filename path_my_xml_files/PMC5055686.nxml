Minding the Baby&#x000ae; (MTB) is an interdisciplinary home-visiting programme developed to support first-time young mothers, which integrates primary care and mental health approaches into a single intensive intervention from the last trimester of pregnancy until the child&#x02019;s second birthday. The primary aim of the intervention is to promote caregiver sensitivity, and, secondarily, to promote both child and maternal socioemotional outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a multisite randomised controlled trial (RCT) with a target recruitment of 200 first-time adolescent mothers (under&#x000a0;26&#x000a0;years of age). One hundred participants will be randomised to the MTB group and they will receive the MTB programme in addition to the usual services available in their areas. Those participants not allocated to MTB will receive Treatment as Usual (TAU) only. Researchers will carry out blind assessments at baseline (before the birth of the baby), and outcome assessments around the child&#x02019;s first and second birthdays. The primary outcome will be the quality of maternal sensitivity and the secondary outcomes will focus on attachment security, child cognitive/language development, behavioural problems, postponed childbearing, maternal mental health and incidents of child protection interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study evaluates the Minding the Baby&#x000ae; programme in the UK.

The programme represents an important opportunity to advance the UK&#x02019;s provision of evidence-based support for at-risk families and to intervene effectively in the intergenerational cycle of disadvantage. The Minding the Baby&#x000ae; (MTB) programme is an interdisciplinary intervention that was developed and tested by a team of researchers and clinicians at the Yale Child Study Centre and the Yale School of Nursing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. MTB combines many of the benefits of home-visiting programmes &#x02013; particularly their relative cost-effectiveness, client acceptability and accessibility &#x02013; with a coherent, evidence-based clinical dimension that is informed by, and directly targets, well-studied mechanisms of risk in early child development. In focussing on key domains of parent-child relationships where disturbances are known risk factors for later child maladjustment, particularly the sensitivity of parental care, the security of infant-parent attachment and the parent&#x02019;s capacity to reflect on the child as an autonomous agent with needs, feelings and thoughts, the programme aims to combine best clinical practice in early prevention with scientific evidence regarding the developmental processes that promote optimal child outcomes. Currently, the UK health and social care systems offer a range of services to young families targeting mental health or promoting family relationships from birth, which are not always evidence-based and vary considerably from region to region. Home-visiting programmes are characterised by the presence of consistent and reliable support figures with high-quality training who are capable of addressing a broad range of parenting concerns from the practical to the emotional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The highly influential Nurse Family Partnership (NFP) model is a well-known example that has been found to be effective for several important early child and maternal outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A notable limitation of existing home-visitation programmes, however, is the relative lack of focus on supporting parent-child interaction and particularly attachment. This is a central target of MTB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Longitudinal outcome studies clearly show that disturbances in the quality of care can have lasting negative consequences for children&#x02019;s development, and the long-term social and financial costs associated with these poor outcomes are likely to be considerable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The potential value of effective early intervention focussed on sensitivity of care, particularly for parents experiencing multiple social adversities, therefore, cannot be overstated.</p><p>This randomised clinical trial will test the hypothesis that an intensive home-visiting programme focussed on promoting young parents&#x02019; sensitive attunement to their infants and their ability to mentalise on their baby&#x02019;s thoughts, feelings and needs, will lead to improvements in the sensitivity of parenting of children age 2&#x000a0;years compared to parents who receive routine care. The study will also examine several secondary hypotheses, including that the programme will increase offspring rates of secure attachment, improve cognitive and behavioural outcomes and promote maternal mental health.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Background and significance</title><p>Although rates of teenage pregnancies have been dropping in the UK over the last 10&#x000a0;years, it remains the case that such pregnancies are greatly over-represented in low-income urban populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The many environmental stressors that these young parents face (poverty, single parenthood, social isolation and poor educational achievement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]) are often amplified by personal histories of abuse, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These parents may find themselves not only having to deal with their own developmental needs but also trying to take on the complex roles and responsibilities of parenting. It is perhaps not surprising that young parents living in these circumstances are more susceptible to mental health problems and may struggle to become responsive nurturing parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Social disadvantage more generally represents a broad but very reliable marker of a host of contextual, psychological and developmental risk factors that have well-established negative impacts on the quality of parenting and on child development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The MTB programme is aimed at supporting young parents facing multiple social stressors, and raising their first infant in adverse social circumstances, in order to promote positive parenting, raise rates of secure attachment and improve child developmental outcomes.</p><p>The MTB programme is the result of an interdisciplinary collaboration between the Yale School of Nursing and the Yale Child Study Centre. MTB is an intensive and preventive home-visitation programme for young first-time parents. MTB primarily evolved from two home-visiting models that originated in the US; the NFP and the infant-parent psychotherapy model. David Olds and colleagues developed the NFP programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], which involves home visits by highly trained nurses to vulnerable high-risk first-time mothers. Home visits begin at the end of the second trimester of pregnancy and continue through the child&#x02019;s second birthday. Extensive research on the effectiveness of the NFP programme in high-risk populations showed improved health, parenting and developmental outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A different emphasise is on the infant-parent psychotherapy model which was developed to protect infants and help parents with mental health problems, often as a result of ongoing trauma. Although this model has been less rigorously tested than the NFP programme, positive child outcomes were found. In particular, this programme appears to supports the development of healthy mother-child relationships and secure attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], both of which are prognostic indicators of longer-term positive developmental outcomes in the child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>The MTB programme brings together both these models, providing a holistic intervention that not only addresses maternal mental health issues but also health, attachment and life course outcomes for mother, child and family. Thus, MTB aims to bring together health, developmental, attachment and mental health approaches. By incorporating both nursing and mental health approaches, MTB serves to address some of the more complex needs of mothers and families at risk.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Attachment and Reflective Functioning</title><p>It is firmly established in the attachment field that the quality of the infant&#x02019;s attachment to their primary caregiver is robustly related to a range of child outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. MTB builds on this evidence and makes the promotion of secure attachment a primary clinical objective as a means of bringing about positive changes in the infant&#x02019;s social, emotional and cognitive development. Originally, Ainsworth and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] suggested that a mother&#x02019;s ability to respond sensitively to her child&#x02019;s cues would be crucial for the development of secure mother-infant attachment. Later research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] empirically tested this hypothesis and found broad support for the role of sensitivity in secure attachment. Furthermore, recent work has highlighted the role of the mother&#x02019;s own mental state with respect to attachment &#x02013; referred to as her internal working model (IWM) of attachment, in shaping the sensitivity of care, and thus her child&#x02019;s attachment security [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. These attachment representations are thought to shape how a parent perceives their child and, accordingly, how they respond to the child&#x02019;s behaviour, cues and communications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>A critical feature of the way in which parents think about their children is their ability to consider the child&#x02019;s thoughts, feelings and beliefs, and to treat the child, therefore, as an individual with a mind. Crucially, research indicates that this ability not only to think of the child as an individual with their own thoughts and feelings, but also to understand and make a causal connection between the child&#x02019;s behaviours and their underlying feelings and experiences, is crucial in the development of a secure attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This capacity has been termed by Fonagy and colleagues as &#x02018;mentalisation&#x02019; or &#x02018;Reflective Functioning&#x02019; (RF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Slade and colleagues&#x02019; research in this area has demonstrated consistent relationships between a mother&#x02019;s ability to mentalise, maternal behaviour, and child attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>The MTB programme is rooted in this developmental theory and, at its core, the MTB programme aims to increase the parent&#x02019;s capacity to think about their child and reflect upon their thoughts, and feelings, and to respond in a sensitive and attuned way to the child&#x02019;s cues and communications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Minding the Baby&#x000ae;: an interdisciplinary approach</title><p>The home-visiting intervention programmes presented above have mostly focussed on either the practical aspects of parenting or the quality of the mother-child relationship and attachment. MTB aims to address both these elements of parenting.</p><p>The UK MTB clinical team includes two qualified practitioners: a nurse or health visitor and a social worker who are both highly trained and supervised in particular techniques and developmental approaches tailored for working with vulnerable young mothers. The nurse provides advanced levels of practical parenting support including individual and family health assessments, nutritional advice and family planning. The social worker provides mental health support to mother and baby, in-home assessment and intervention for mild to moderate mental health problems like depression, anxiety and PTSD symptoms that the mother might be affected by. Crucial to the success of the MTB programme is the mother&#x02019;s relationship with the MTB practitioners. Their engagement and fostering of ongoing relationships with these at-risk, first-time young mothers, as well as having the professional expertise that matches their complex health, social and mental health needs, is aimed to diminish attrition from the programme. This kind of integrative model is considered to be crucial for maximising both parental and child outcomes across a range of domains.</p><p>Following the Yale model, the UK MTB is grounded in well-established developmental research, builds on the experience of similar successful programmes, is a relationship-based model, delivers a flexible model of care design to match the varying and often complex needs of at-risk families, and has a robust, manualised system of training and supervision.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>Aim 1: the primary aim of this study is to test whether participation in the MTB programme leads to improvements in the quality of parenting and specifically the degree of maternal sensitivity.</p><p>Aim 2: the secondary aims of the study are to measure the effects of the MTB programme in relation to (1) maternal outcomes including maternal mental health, maternal RF and postponed subsequent child bearing and (2) infant outcomes including incidents of child protection intervention, attachment security to the parent, cognitive and language development and behavioural problems.</p><p>Aim 3: a further key secondary aim is to assess the cost benefit/cost-effectiveness of the MTB programme in order to sustain future programmes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Design</title><p>This is a multisite randomised controlled trial, with randomisation at the case level. This trial will utilise a two-arm design, with random allocation to either MTB plus Treatment as Usual (TAU) or a TAU-only control condition. Allocation will be by minimisation, controlling for maternal age, maternal depression and study site.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Outcome measures</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The primary outcome is the quality of parenting, operationalised as maternal sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Maternal sensitivity will be measured at ages 1 and 2&#x000a0;years and will be treated as a continuous score, with both time points included in the primary analysis.</p><p>In order to measure parenting sensitivity at ages 1 and 2&#x000a0;years, we will use several short tasks from our existing studies of attachment and another ongoing clinical trial. The first task focusses on mother-infant interaction in the context of free-play. Known as the &#x02018;three-boxes procedure&#x02019;, the mother shows the child experimenter-provided toys in three containers in a set order [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The second is a procedure pioneered by Smith and Pederson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In this task, mother and infant are left to explore a relatively empty room, while the mother must also complete a distraction questionnaire. Another task involves brief observations, one focussing on book-sharing and the other on a difficult-to-manipulate toy. Finally, we are using a separate joint book-reading observation in which the content of the book involves strong attachment-related scenarios. In each case, maternal sensitivity will be rated, using Emotional Availability Scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], an observation tool. The scales describe and assess four dimensions on the adult side (sensitivity, structuring, nonintrusiveness and nonhostility) and two dimensions on the child side (responsiveness and involvement with the caregiver). Dimensions are measured on a scale, with scores of between 1 and 7. Scales will be standardised and summed to yield a total score across all tasks for the main analysis. The use of specific contexts for mother-infant interactions will also allow us to determine whether the intervention is changing the particular processes associated with each domain of child development in tertiary analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>
<italic>Child attachment security</italic>, measured with the Attachment Q-Set (AQS: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]), which will be administered at year 2. The AQS is based on a set period of observation of children aged 1&#x02013;5 years in the home environment. The AQS consists of a set of 90 cards with a specific behavioural characteristic described on each card that is age-appropriate. The cards are used as a standard vocabulary to describe the behaviour of a child in a home setting, with an emphasis on secure-base behaviour. The researcher who has observed the parent and child ranks the cards into several piles from &#x02018;most descriptive of the subject&#x02019; to &#x02018;least descriptive of the subject&#x02019;. The Q-Set provides a score along a continuum of secure to insecure. The Q-Set has shown good convergent and discriminate validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and is a strong predictor of later developmental outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Child cognitive and language development</italic> will be assessed at year 2 using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, third edition (Bayley-III) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The Bayley-III is an individually administered assessment that evaluates the child&#x02019;s mental and motor development. The scales are administered when children are between the ages of 2&#x000a0;months and 42&#x000a0;months. This yields two separate continuous scales representing overall cognitive development and language development. The Bayley-III is a standardised instrument and the cognitive scales and language composite correlate, respectively (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.79) and (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.82), with the WPPSI-III Full-scale IQ (Weschler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence), reported for children aged 28&#x02013;42 months. Bayley-III is also UK-validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Behavioural problems</italic> will be assessed with the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]) questionnaire at year 2. This consists of a 100-item parent-report questionnaire and is valid for children from 18&#x000a0;months and older. The CBCL measure yields three age-normed scales of Internalising Problems (i.e. anxious, depressive, and over-controlled), Externalising Problems (i.e. aggressive, hyperactive, noncompliant, and under-controlled) and Total Problems. Parents record responses with: 0 (Not true, as far as I know), 1 (Somewhat or Sometimes true) or 2 (Very true or Often true). The analysis will focus on the Total Problem scale. The CBCL is one of the most widely-used standardised measures in child psychology for evaluating maladaptive behavioural and emotional problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Postponed child-bearing</italic> will be assessed at each follow-up when mothers will be asked about their pregnancy status. The number of months from baseline to the next pregnancy will be used for analysis.</p><p>
<italic>Maternal mental health</italic> will be measured with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]) questionnaire which will be administered at baseline, year 1 and year 2. The EPDS is a 10-item questionnaire screening for postnatal depression. Mothers&#x02019; responses are on a scale of 0 to 3, and a score is calculated adding individual items. All three total scores from the questionnaire will be entered into the analysis, with change from baseline being the outcome of interest. EPDS is a well-validated measure of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] that may be used within 8&#x000a0;weeks postpartum but has also been applied for depression screening during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Child Quality of Life</italic> will be assessed at year-1 and year-2 follow-ups with the Warwick Child Health and Morbidity Profile (WCHMP) questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. This consists in a 10-item survey where parents are asked to report on health and morbidity in infancy and childhood. The WCHMP has shown to be reliable and valid with low interobserver variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) will be calculated and the two groups of mothers compared.</p><p>
<italic>Health and social care resource use</italic> will be collected throughout the study using the Service Use and Supports Questionnaire (SUS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. This is a self-report questionnaire administered at baseline and every subsequent follow-up, i.e. 6&#x000a0;months, year 1, 18&#x000a0;months and year 2. Mothers are asked to note whether they had any input from professionals and voluntary agencies in the previous 6&#x000a0;months, in four areas: (1) health services, (2) mental health services, (3) support services and (4) child care services. Parents are also asked to note down the single most helpful service they have accessed over the previous 6&#x000a0;months. Costs are applied to service use at each time point. Total costs per patient will be calculated from the total across all follow-up points and adjusted for by baseline values.

<italic>Infant Behaviour Questionnaire Revised</italic> (IBQ-R: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]) is a parent-report questionnaire that ask parents to rate the frequency of specific temperament-related behaviours observed over the past week (or sometimes 2&#x000a0;weeks). The IBQ-R assesses the child&#x02019;s temperament on six dimensions including activity level, soothability, fear, smiling and approach behaviours. Parents rate the frequency of specific temperament-related behaviours on a scale of 1 to 7. The IBQ-R has demonstrated good internal consistency, reliability and convergent validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The IBQ-R will be administered at year 1.</p><p>
<italic>Infant Health Outcome</italic> data will be collected at the end of the study through a review of the infant&#x02019;s/toddler&#x02019;s health records. Data will be collected on birth outcomes, routine hospital visits, completeness of immunisations, accident and emergency (A&#x00026;E) visits, presence of chronic health problems and number of referrals to Social Services. Unit costs will be applied to calculate the cost per infant.</p><p>
<italic>Maternal Sense of Mastery</italic> is measured by the Pearlin and Schooler 7-item scale. Women are asked to measure the degree to which they perceive they can control their life&#x02019;s chances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Responses are based on a 7-item scale (agreement to disagreement), and higher scores reflect greater level of mastery. This scale has been used extensively with similar samples of young women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. It will be administered at baseline, 1- and 2-year follow-ups.</p><p>
<italic>Norbeck Social Support Questionnaire</italic> (NSSQ: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]) measures multiple functional dimensions of social support: (1) affect, (2) affirmation and (3) aid. Participants are instructed to list first names or initials for each significant person in their lives who provides personal support to them. Participants are asked to identify their relationship with the individual and finally to use a 5-point rating scale to describe the amount of support available from each person. The NSSQ has shown to be a valid and reliable measure of all three functional types of social support as well as total network support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. It will be administered at baseline, 1- and 2-year follow-ups.</p><p>
<italic>Parent Development Interview &#x02013; Revised</italic> (PDI: Slade A, Aber JL, Bresgi I, Berger B, Kaplan M. The Parent Development Interview - Revised. The City University of New York, 2004. Unpublished Manuscript.) is a 20-question interview that assesses parents&#x02019; representations of their child, their relationships with them, and particularly their capacity to reflect on their child&#x02019;s mental states. Transcribed interviews are scored for RF. Initial studies testing the validity of this measure have linked it to adult attachment, child attachment and parental behaviour both in normal and drug-using samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].

<italic>Parenting Stress Inventory</italic> (PSI) <italic>Short Form</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] is a 36-item questionnaire that measures stress levels experienced within the parenting role. Rated on a 5-point scale (agreement to disagreement), the measure contains three subscales pertaining to parenting stress. The PSI Short Form (PSI-SF) subscales have demonstrated concurrent validity with the full-length PSI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. The PSI-SF will be administered at baseline, 1- and 2-year follow-ups.</p><p>
<italic>PTSD Checklist-Civilian</italic> (PCL-5: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]). This is a 20-item PTSD screen that is closely based on the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition</italic> (DSM-V) criteria for PTSD. Participants rate each item from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) to indicate the degree to which they have been bothered by the index symptom in the past month. The PCL-C has shown good psychometric properties, high rates of internal consistency, test-retest reliability and is highly correlated with other measures of trauma symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. It will be administered at baseline, 1- and 2-year follow-ups.</p><p>
<italic>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory</italic> (STAI: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]) is a 40-item questionnaire that uses a 4-point Likert scale to address both state and trait anxiety. The construct and concurrent validity of the measure has been robustly demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. It will be administered at baseline, 1- and 2-year follow-ups.</p><p>
<italic>Adult quality of life (QoL) &#x02013;</italic> The EuroQol EQ-5D 3 level (EQ-5D-3&#x000a0;L) is a health-related questionnaire assessing the quality of life through five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each dimension is scored by choosing one of three responses. The responses recorded are based on levels of severity (no problems/some or moderate problems/extreme problems). Utility scores will be calculated for each mother at each time point based on the algorithm developed by Dolan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Utility scores at each time point will be used to calculate total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for the duration of the trial calculated as the area under the curve adjusting for baseline. It will be administered at baseline, 1- and 2-year follow-ups.</p><p>
<italic>Treatment Experience Questionnaire</italic> (TEQ). This is a 15-item feedback questionnaire based on questionnaires used for similar studies (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. This will be given to participants in the MTB arm of the trial only, to record satisfaction with the service they have received. Parents are asked to rate the treatment on a 5-point scale (disagreement to agreement). It will be administered at the year 1 and year 2.</p><p>
<italic>Father outcome measures</italic>. Where possible we aim to collect selected outcome measurements from fathers at baseline, year-1 and year-2 follow-ups. Some of the outcome measures used for the mothers will also be used for the fathers: quality of life (i.e. EQ-5D); mental health (i.e. EPDS, STAI and PCL-5), support and personal network (i.e. NSSQ), and paternal competence (i.e. SM and PSI), and the Treatment Experience Questionnaire (TEQ) for fathers in the MTB group.

Potential participants will then be followed up by a research midwife who will check eligibility, provide them with written information about the study again (Participant Information Sheet and a &#x02018;contact leaflet&#x02019;) and will verbally explain their involvement. This will usually be done in person at the 20-week scan appointment, but may also be done by telephone (with written material sent by post) or during another antenatal appointment.

These forms will then be collected by the research midwives, and passed to the research team who will then get in touch to arrange a visit, following the same informed consent procedures described above. Similar contact leaflets and Participant Information Sheets will also be distributed to community midwives and other health, social care and voluntary-sector professionals (e.g. GPs, local authority housing officers, Shelter) in the area so that if they know of mothers meeting the eligibility criteria they can make them aware of the study. Such mothers would be directed to the research team&#x02019;s contact telephone number, or contact leaflets can be sent to the research team, who will then call the participant. Professionals working with families, having obtained verbal consent, may also contact the research team on behalf of the family.

Both Sheffield and Glasgow FNPs enroll parents into the programme up until 20&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation and, as such, the MTB trial will not interfere with client accessibility to the FNP treatment. However, participants will be excluded if they are receiving services from the FNP. This criterion is necessary to ensure the integrity of the TAU arm of the trial.

Ethical issues are discussed in greater depth below, but we note at this point that in addition to obtaining consent to access medical and social care records, the recruiter will be obliged to explicitly explain the limits of confidentiality in the event that a child protection concern arises. For those not consenting to participate, we will nevertheless endeavour to obtain anonymised summary data from primary care services to characterise these cases, as prior work by our group has found that these missing cases over-represent populations in most need [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. For any families that drop out of the clinical project after randomisation, we will endeavour to retain them in the research study in order to minimise bias. In addition, even families who drop out of the research study will be asked whether permission can remain to access their medical and social care records so that data on child health outcomes can nevertheless be obtained.

A computer-generated adaptive minimisation algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] that incorporates a random element will be used with the following balancing factors: treatment centre, maternal age (below 20 versus 20&#x000a0;years or older) and current depressive symptomatology (&#x0003c;&#x02009;10 versus &#x02265;&#x02009;10 on the EPDS). These minimisation factors have been selected because previous research has shown that these factors are associated with poorer outcomes on some of our dependent measures or are highly plausible treatment modifiers. Once a family has been approached and has consented to take part, anonymised screening data will be sent to the randomisation centre by the trial coordinator. The randomisation centre will send the results of the randomisation to the local clinical manager within 72&#x000a0;h, ensuring that the research team is fully blind to the condition that the family is allocated to. Participants will be informed about their group allocation, as blinding to a psychosocial treatment of this nature is not possible. The outcome assessors will be blind to the participants&#x02019; allocation. During training, all research assistants (RAs) will be briefed regarding the importance of blindness to condition and they will record any instances where the participating family discloses its condition inadvertently, so that the impact of this can be examined in the data analysis.

In one of the key studies of the NFP programme, active refusals to participate in the trial ran at approximately 20&#x000a0;% (with a further 20&#x000a0;% passively dropping out by not responding to mailed invitations to participate), which is higher than the estimates from the Yale pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, it is notable that a much smaller proportion refused to participate in the research evaluation once they had agreed to randomisation (3.8&#x000a0;%). From the outset of the FNP study to the 2-year outcome phase a further 21&#x000a0;% were lost to follow-up. In the UK, the FNP programme had an initial uptake rate of 83&#x000a0;% of eligible families and a later dropout rate of 15&#x000a0;%. We thus aim to over-recruit by 15&#x000a0;% to take attrition into account, leading to an initial intake target of <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;240, so that 100 per arm is achieved at the year-2 outcome point.

The primary analysis for this outcome will be Cox regression, adjusting for key baseline characteristics.</p><p>Where there are missing data, these will be evaluated either by multiple imputation or a sensitivity analysis determined by the pattern of missing data. In doing so, we will follow the procedures and guidance outlined by Sterne and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Mediational analyses of change mechanisms (e.g. age 12&#x000a0;months&#x02019; maternal sensitivity-mediating treatment effects on attachment at age 2&#x000a0;years) will be tested using bootstrap methods described by MacKinnon and Dwyer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>] and Preacher and Hayes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Additional data analysis</title><sec id="Sec34"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>We will conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of MTB relative to the control condition from a broad societal perspective.</p><p>Cost information: we propose two elements to the cost component of the cost-effectiveness analysis:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Cost of MTB: this will include fixed costs associated with the resources required to run the service as well as variable costs associated with training, staffing and related consumables. We will calculate a bottom-up costing of the service and calculate a weighted cost per case based on the caseload of each practitioner</p></list-item><list-item><p>Costs of the use of other resources: we will use a self-completed Service User and Support (SUS) questionnaire to collect other health and social care and out-of-pocket costs for clients in the MTB and the control group. The retrospective self-completed questionnaire will provide information on resources accessed during the last 6&#x000a0;months. The SUS will be completed at enrolment, 6&#x000a0;months after the baby is born by telephone and at each outcome assessment (infant age 1 and 2&#x000a0;years). Resource use will be costed using Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU) and national datasets wherever possible</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>We will provide summary statistics of the costs for the MTB and the control group as well as a comparison of the total cost per patient to society of MTB compared to controls for the duration of the study.</p><p>Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER): the ICER is the mean cost per mother/child in the intervention minus the mean cost per patient in the control group divided by the mean incremental gain per mother/child in outcomes from the intervention compared to the controls. If an intervention has a lower cost to society and better outcomes it is considered dominant and likely to be adopted by a decision-maker if the evidence is satisfactory. If the intervention has higher cost to society but is associated with better outcomes the decision-maker needs adequate information to determine if they are willing to pay the additional cost per outcome gained.</p><p>We propose calculating a number of ICERs for MTB compared to controls and propose using the following outcomes in the denominator of the ICER for different analyses:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Maternal sensitivity</p></list-item><list-item><p>Infant QoL using the Warwick Child Health and Morbidity Profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p>Parental QoL using the EQ-5D, which is a brief questionnaire that measures generic health-related quality of life from the patient&#x02019;s point of view.

</p><p>As the ICER does not easily allow for normal statistical tests we will use bootstrapping methods, replications of the statistic of interest by sampling with replacement from the original data, to calculate the confidence interval for the ICER. We will also use this data and the net-monetary benefit approach to calculate the probability that MTB is cost-effective compared to the control group for a number of values of willingness to pay per gain in outcome or the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This provides more information to decision-makers to help them decide if the outcomes achieved as a result of the intervention are worth the additional cost.</p><p>Lifetime model: poor parent-child relationships, child abuse and neglect can have long-term negative impacts on children, their families and society. Poor parenting has repeatedly been identified as being associated with antisocial behaviour and severe behavioural problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A long-term follow-up study of children with conduct disorder suggested that the cost of unresolved conduct disorders can exceed &#x000a3;1 million over an individual&#x02019;s lifetime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There are obviously further costs and benefits to realise as a result of preventing each case of child abuse and neglect. The ICERs proposed above do not capture the full lifetime costs and outcomes that may be realised as a result of MTB. As part of the project we would, therefore, aim to investigate developing a decision analytical model that uses information available from the evaluation, as well as published data sources, to determine the cost-effectiveness of MTB over the lifetime of the children.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Data monitoring</title><sec id="Sec36"><title>Data monitoring</title><p>The Trial Steering Committee (TSC) will take the role of monitoring trial safety and data monitoring.

A key feature of this approach is the way in which it combines health input from community nurses with mental health input from social workers. Another key feature is the explicit focus on promoting sensitivity of parenting, and a model of change based on the assumption, supported by developmental research, that parental RF is critical in promoting sensitive and attuned interactions between mother and infant. The trial represents the first UK study of MTB.</p><p>The MTB programme was developed at Yale University where a pilot trial produced encouraging results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Positive outcomes emerged in relation to attachment as well as health and mental health outcomes. In particular, infants allocated to the MTB group showed higher rates of secure attachment, and mothers showed improvements in maternal RF as well as positive health outcomes compared to the control group. Crucially, these outcomes appeared to be lasting as benefits continued to be observed when the children were seen at the ages of 3 and 5&#x000a0;years.</p><p>We predict that similar outcomes will emerge from this intervention in the UK. In particular, mothers randomised to the MTB group, compared to the mothers in the TAU group, are expected to show higher observed sensitivity as well as more secure attachment. Findings will be published in scientific journals, shared with stakeholders and will inform child and maternal health policy. The study will have important implications for the delivery of early intervention to families who are potentially at risk, especially during the crucial first months and years of life, from pregnancy to age 2&#x000a0;years.</p><sec id="Sec40"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruiting of expectant mothers started in April 2014 and we are still recruiting.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec41"><title>Additional file</title><p>
