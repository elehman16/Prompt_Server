Most smokers smoke their first cigarette in early adolescence. We took advantage of the widespread availability of mobile phones and adolescents&#x02019; interest in appearance to develop a free photoaging app which is promoted via a poster campaign in secondary schools. This study aims to evaluate its effectiveness regarding smoking prevalence and students&#x02019; attitudes towards smoking.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A randomised controlled trial is conducted with 9851 students of both genders with an average age of 12&#x02005;years in grades 6 and 7 of 126 secondary schools in Germany. At present, cigarette smoking prevalence in our sample is 4.7%, with 4.6% of the students currently using e-cigarettes (1.6% use both). The prospective experimental study design includes measurements at baseline and at 6, 12 and 24&#x02005;months postintervention via a questionnaire plus a random cotinine saliva sample at 24&#x02005;months postintervention. The study groups consist of randomised schools receiving the Smokerface poster campaign and control schools with comparable baseline data (no intervention). The primary end point is the difference of change in smoking prevalence in the intervention group versus the difference in the control group at 24&#x02005;months follow-up. Longitudinal changes in smoking-related attitudes, the number of new smokers and quitters and the change in the number of never-smokers will be compared between the two groups as secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the ethics committee of the University of Gie&#x000df;en and the ministries of cultural affairs, both in Germany. Results will be disseminated at conferences, in peer-reviewed journals, on our websites and throughout the multinational Education Against Tobacco network.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02544360">NCT02544360</ext-link>, Pre-results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Smokerface</kwd><kwd>tobacco prevention</kwd><kwd>mobile apps</kwd><kwd>schools</kwd><kwd>photoaging</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Deutsche Herzstiftung</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005971</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Smokerface Randomized Trial</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This is the first randomised trial on app-based tobacco prevention in the school setting.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The majority of German 12-year-old pupils use smartphones on a regular basis.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The campaign is easy to implement, may be added to existing campaigns and costs &#x0003c;&#x020ac;50 per school.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A random cotinine saliva sample is obtained for biochemical validation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The large sample and the method of data collection provide valuable epidemiological data on adolescent smoking in Germany.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Smoking is a risk factor for various diseases, leading to the highest number of avoidable deaths in Germany and worldwide.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Most smokers start smoking in early adolescence<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and relatively few of those who become regular smokers manage to quit later in life.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The 2016 HBSC international report by the WHO revealed that 15% of boys and 13% of girls aged 15&#x02005;years claimed to have smoked at least once a week in Germany in 2013/2014.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In spite of the decline in prevalence over recent years, strong socioeconomic and educational inequalities in smoking exist.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref></p><p>Many effective school-based interventions that prevent smoking are based on external mentors and thus not broadly available.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> This limitation is often accompanied by high costs or organisational effort, which reduces practical implementation in schools.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Photoaging desktop programs in which an image is altered to predict future appearance have been shown to help motivate women aged 14&#x02013;18&#x02005;years to quit smoking and increased the quit rate in young adults aged 18&#x02013;30&#x02005;years of both genders by 21%.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>

We demonstrated its implementation in a small cross-sectional pilot study via a technique called mirroring: The students&#x02019; altered three-dimensional self-portraits on mobile phones or tablets were &#x02018;mirrored&#x02019; via a projector in front of their whole grade.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Our pilot study showed that the app motivates German adolescents not to smoke. However, the method of implementation used in the pilot study cost &#x020ac;2&#x02005;000 per school, requires the time of health educators and longitudinal effects were not measured. In this trial, the photoaging app is implemented in secondary schools via a low cost (&#x020ac;50 per school) and widespread poster campaign.</p><p>We designed this randomised trial to answer the following main questions: Is this low-cost campaign effective in convincing students to use the app? Which students are more likely to use an app revealing the photoaging effects of smoking? How does this campaign or the use of the app affect smoking prevalence among the students or change their attitudes towards smoking in accordance with the Theory of Planned Behavior?<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design</title><p>The Smokerface trial is designed as a randomised, controlled superiority multicentred trial with two parallel groups and a primary end point of the difference in smoking prevalence from baseline to follow-up compared between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016014288F1">figure 1</xref>).

The randomisation of schools based on the baseline data was completed from February through 1 May 2016. Immediately after randomisation, the posters were hung by trained data collectors from March through June of 2016. The first follow-up survey will be 6&#x02005;months thereafter. At 1-year follow-up (March&#x02013;June 2017) and at 2-year follow-up (March&#x02013;June 2018), the third and fourth waves of the survey will be conducted.

The posters include large images of the short-term photoaging effects of smoking (1 pack a day for 1&#x02005;year) and small images of the long-term effects (1 pack a day for 15&#x02005;years). The posters illustrate brittle hair and earlier hair loss due to smoking,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>

The models are both male and female and appear to be about 17&#x02005;years old, so that they are perceived as role models by both genders of our young target group. The posters are in German (English translation for publication purposes). In the corner of each poster, pupils are asked to find out what their faces would look like as smokers by downloading the free Smokerface app.</p><p>A small pilot study with 91 pupils identified that 89/91 (97.8%) noticed the posters but only about 20% of them realised that there was a free app (first version; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016014288F2">figure 2</xref>A, B). Therefore, we optimised the posters to provide a stronger call to action and added a QR code (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016014288F3">figure 3</xref>A, B).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2016014288F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>(A): Female version of the pretested Smokerface poster.

Teachers and parents are also encouraged to use the app with their students and all smokers are provided quit advice (brief quit-advice and free motivational cessation app &#x02018;Smokerstop&#x02019;).</p></sec><sec id="s2b3"><title>Raffle and change of posters at 12&#x02005;months follow-up</title><p>To further increase adherence to the app in a way that does not confound the effects of the original intervention, a raffle is implemented directly after the 1&#x02005;year follow-up.

This is performed in the same manner as with the posters at baseline. The purpose of this is to further increase the number of app users and to counteract the diminishing salience of the original posters to the students over time, a process which has been described in detail with graphic health warnings.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> However, since no selfie looks the same, we expect that at least the pupils who installed the app do not get used to the effects as fast as this is the case with graphic health warnings.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2016014288F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>(A): Female version of the optimised Smokerface poster (15-year version).

Additional posters are provided to the person responsible for each school (mostly teachers) so that they can replace posters in their schools that are vandalised or ripped down. During the first 12&#x02005;months, each intervention school will receive a bimonthly email reminder asking how many of the posters are still hanging or have been replaced. At the 6, 12 and 24&#x02005;months follow-ups, the percentage of posters still available and intact is checked and noted by our trained data collectors. In addition, our questionnaire for the intervention group includes an item asking the pupils the quantity of posters still hanging in their school (all, more than half, less than half, none, do not know).

The smoking prevalence within grade 7 of the school (&#x0003e;4.1%/&#x02264;4.1%), the school size (&#x0003e;100 pupils/&#x02264;100 pupils) and the participation in &#x02018;Smokefree&#x02019; (SF; participation vs no participation) were considered as factors for stratification.</p><sec id="s2g1"><title>Smokefree</title><p>In the Rhine-Neckar region, we have to consider the primary smoking intervention group &#x02018;Smokefree&#x02019; (SF; German: &#x02018;ohnekippe&#x02019;), which takes place in 32 schools included from this area,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> as a confounder.

For all end points, the number needed to treat (NNT) will be calculated in addition. Considering the low costs of the intervention, we predefined a NNT below 100 as clinically relevant.

<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> All baseline data were collected before the e-cigarette sales ban was implemented on 1 April 2016 in Germany. This is the first national study to show that current e-cigarette and cigarette smoking prevalence in grades 6 and 7 of secondary schools are the same (4.7% use cigarettes and 4.6% use e-cigarettes). Almost a third of these (1.6% of the total sample) currently use both products at the same time.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The 6&#x02005;months follow-up of this survey will also reveal the effectiveness of the e-cigarette sales ban to our very sensitive age group. The epidemiological data presented here is therefore also valuable considering that the most cited and most recent surveys in Germany were conducted via telephone interviews, a method showing poor consistency with biochemical validation in our age group.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
