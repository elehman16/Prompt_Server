Traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking and inflammation, which has gained much attention more recently[<xref rid="pone.0128695.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128695.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].

Recently, there is an upsurge in the popularity of TCM products among consumers outside China. In 2010, the United States spent $7.6 billion on TCM products and Europe $2 billion [<xref rid="pone.0128695.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Factors that contribute to the increased use of TCM products are the increased prevalence of obesity and related chronic disorders, increasing costs of conventional medicines and the belief that TCM products are safer and more effective than prescription drugs [<xref rid="pone.0128695.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Danshen is the dried root extract of the plant Salvia Miltiorrhiza and is widely used in Asia to treat coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia and cerebrovascular disease[<xref rid="pone.0128695.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The estimated number of patients using Danshen is approximately 5 million worldwide[<xref rid="pone.0128695.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. According to TCM theory, Danshen is used in patients to treat &#x0201c;blood stasis&#x0201d; as it &#x0201c;moves blood&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0128695.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The TCM-qualification of &#x0201c;blood stasis&#x0201d; is made by identification of certain changes in the tongue and pulse. The major components of Danshen are hydrophilic salvianolic acids and lipophilic tanshinones[<xref rid="pone.0128695.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In vitro treatment of human monocyte derived macrophages with a combination of Danshen and Gegen resulted in a suppression of acetylated Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) uptake [<xref rid="pone.0128695.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Two active components of Danshen, salvianolic acid A and magnesium tanshinoate B, inhibit LDL oxidation [<xref rid="pone.0128695.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A mixture of Chinese herbs, including Danshen, has been shown to exert beneficial effects on high-fat diet induced metabolic syndrome in rats [<xref rid="pone.0128695.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Also in humans, Danshen may reduce LDL-levels and blood pressure [<xref rid="pone.0128695.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the quality of randomized clinical trials of Danshen is poor [<xref rid="pone.0128695.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128695.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and not easily accessible to Western physicians since most are published in Chinese.</p><p>Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the effect of Danshen on hyperlipidemia and hypertension, two well validated risk factors for cardiovascular disease according to evidence-based medicine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Study Population</title><p>The study population consisted of 20 subjects aged 40&#x02013;70 years with hyperlipidemia and hypertension, who were recruited through advertisements in local newspapers (<xref rid="pone.0128695.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Included were subjects with a fasting LDL cholesterol &#x0003e; 3.5 mmol/l and/or triglycerides &#x0003e; 1.7 mmol/l. Patients treated with antihypertensive drugs were eligible when the average of three office blood pressure recordings (sphygmomanometer, sitting position, at least 5 minutes interval) revealed a systolic blood pressure &#x0003e; 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &#x0003e; 90 mmHg. For subjects that were not treated with antihypertensives, blood pressure was recorded three times on two separate visits (in total 6 recordings, in sitting position, sphygmomanometer, 5 minute intervals between recordings on each visit) and again average blood pressure had to fulfill the criterium of &#x0003e; 140 mmHg for systolic and/or &#x0003e; 90 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure. Excluded were subjects with triglycerides &#x0003e; 8 mmol/l and/or LDL-cholesterol &#x0003e; 5 mmol/l or systolic blood pressure &#x0003e; 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &#x0003e; 110 mmHg. Further exclusion criteria were treatment with statins, use of more than 1 antihypertensive drug, use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, calcium antagonists or vitamin and/or herbal supplements, diabetes mellitus treated with insulin, a history of cardiovascular disease, use of anticoagulant drugs, a serum alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase level of more than 3 times the upper limit of normal and abnormal creatinin clearance defined as MDRD&#x0003c; 60 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>. The exclusion of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and calcium antagonists was based on documented improvement by these drugs of acetylcholine-induced forearm vasodilation, as opposed to non-dilating beta blockers and thiazide diuretics [<xref rid="pone.0128695.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128695.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

<italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> root water-extract (Danshen), randomization procedure and blinding</title><p>
<italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> extract was produced by Kaiser Pharmaceuticals Co. in Taiwan. This product was obtained from a specialized pharmacy NatuurApotheek. Using this extract, Basic Pharma Manufacturing BV produced Danshen and placebo capsules. Each capsule contained 500 mg granulate consisting of 50% water-extract of Danshen and 50% starch. Therefore, a dosage of 4 capsules tid with 500 mg granulate is equal to 4 capsules with 250 mg extract tid (3 g daily). Since the root&#x02014;extract ratio is 5:1, 3 gram extract originates from 15 g root. The Pharmacopoeia of the People&#x02019;s Republic of China recommends a dosage of 9&#x02013;15 g root daily [<xref rid="pone.0128695.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. So, we used in this study the highest dose of Danshen that is regularly used in TCM. In this way, we wanted to reduce any doubts about insufficient dosing in case of lack of efficacy or overdosing in case of unexpected adverse events.</p><p>Briefly, the production process of Danshen is as follows: first a water decoction of Salvia root is made. Subsequently, the water-extract is concentrated 5 times via a standard distillation procedure. After the concentration procedure, a drying and granulation procedure (with 50% starch as carrier) followed using a fluid bed spray dryer. Then the granules are filtered, which results in a final bulk product consisting of granules of a specified size. Finally, the bulk product is filled into containers. The NatuurApotheek also prepared the placebo&#x02019;s according to Good Manufacuring Practice and filled these in equally appearing containers. Placebo and Danshen capsules were similar in appearance. The labels of the containers included the randomization number (two containers (placebo and Danshen) per randomization number), and period number. The Natuurapotheek performed the randomization. The randomization list which linked randomization number to treatment order, was stored at a safe place at the Clinical Research Centre Nijmegen. Participants received a number according to inclusion order and received the medication with randomization number that equaled the inclusion number. The research team involved in recruitment, assessment of primary, secondary and explorative outcome measurements (including laboratory personnel) and data entry as well as participants remained blinded until all data had been entered in the database and the database had been monitored by an independent trial monitor.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Biochemical analyses</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Lipids</title><p>Blood was drawn in fasting state before and after each treatment period to measure total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B.

Total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were measured using an enzymatic method. For determination of HDL-levels, direct immunoinhibition was used. Apolipoprotein B levels were determined by turbidimetry (all Architect, Abbott Diagnostics Division). Coefficients of variation were for total cholesterol &#x0003c;3%, triglycerides &#x0003c;5%, HDL-cholesterol &#x02264;4% and for apolipoprotein B &#x02264;6.5%.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Metabolic and inflammatory parameters</title><p>Glucose concentrations were measured using the glucose oxidase-peroxidase method.

The experiments started at 8.30 a.m. after an overnight fast in a quiet, temperature controlled room (23&#x000b0;C&#x02013;24&#x000b0;C). Study medication was ingested at home, prior to visiting our clinical research department. The subjects were studied after 24 hours of caffeine abstinence. The brachial artery of the non-dominant arm (experimental forearm) was cannulated (27-gauge needle, Braun, Melsungen, Germany) for infusion of vasodilators. FBF was measured at both forearms simultaneously. The upper arm cuffs were inflated using a rapid cuff inflator (Hokanson E-20, DE Hokanson, Bellevue, WA). Wrist cuffs were inflated to 220 mm Hg to occlude the hand circulation during the infusion of both vasodilators and their baselines [<xref rid="pone.0128695.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Forearm volume was measured with the water displacement method and all drugs were dosed per 100 ml forearm tissue with a constant infusion rate of 100 &#x003bc;l.dl<sup>-1</sup>.min<sup>-1</sup> during infusion of solvent (baseline recordings) as well as during infusion of increasing doses of vasodilators</p><p>After complete instrumentation, a 30 minute equilibration period followed, after which baseline measurements were performed with infusion of saline.

Acetylcholine stimulates endothelial muscarinic receptors thereby activating nitric oxide synthase. This results in endothelial release of nitric oxide (NO) causing vasodilation[<xref rid="pone.0128695.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Each dose was infused for 5 minutes and FBF was measured. After the last acetylcholine dose, a 30 minutes equilibration period followed. Subsequently, baseline measurements were performed with the infusion of glucose 5% solution.

The thrombin generation curve represents the following parameters: (i) lag-time, the time to the start of thrombin formation; (ii) thrombin peak time, i.e. the time when thrombin production reaches maximal velocity; (iii) thrombin peak height, the maximal velocity of thrombin generation; and (iv) the area under the curve (AUC) for the total amount of thrombin formed. Plasmin generation is described by: (v) fibrin lysis time, the time between the initiation of thrombin generation and the time plasmin generation reaches maximal velocity; (vi) plasmin peak-height, the maximal velocity of plasmin production; and (vii) plasmin potential, area under the curve that represents the total amount of plasmin generated. The inter-assay variation of thrombin generation parameters varies from 5.9% (AUC) to 25% (lag time thrombin generation).

One serious adverse event occurred during Danshen treatment: a peripheral facial nerve paralysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec029"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study did not find beneficial effects of four weeks of treatment with Danshen on cardiovascular risk factors. This is based on the observation that Danshen does not reduce LDL and triglyceride levels and does not decrease blood pressure. Furthermore, Danshen had no effect on endothelial function, markers of inflammation, oxidative stress and glucose metabolism nor on hemostatic and rheological markers.</p><p>These results are in contrast with previous studies. A number of explanations may underlie the lack of reduction of cardiovascular risk markers in this study. First, we only used Danshen and not a combination of Chinese herbs.</p><p>Tan et al. have shown that a combination of 3 Chinese herbs, including Danshen, decreased fasting triglycerides, cholesterol and non-esterified fatty acids in rats with metabolic syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0128695.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The Fufang Danshen dripping pill, which is a composite of <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic>, <italic>Panax notogingseng</italic> and <italic>Cinnamomum camphora</italic>, reduced triglycerides, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels [<xref rid="pone.0128695.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Second, there are over 80 components of Danshen of which 3 lipophilic and 3 hydrophilic components seem to be the major active components [<xref rid="pone.0128695.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128695.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our Danshen product was produced via water-extraction method. Possibly, a low concentration in the water-extract of pharmacologically active lipophilic compounds, including tanshinones, led to a lack of efficacy of Danshen. Unfortunately, an alcohol-extract of Danshen is not available in the Netherlands for human use.</p><p>Third, the selection of participants was based on evidence-based criteria of increased cardiovascular risk, i.e. increased LDL cholesterol or triglyceride levels and hypertension. The TCM qualification &#x0201c;blood stasis&#x0201d; was only made in 2 out of the 20 participants. Since according to the TCM theory Danshen is used to treat &#x0201c;blood stasis&#x0201d;, advocators of this theory could argue that the selected population might not be suitable to detect any cardiovascular benefit. It is not known what diagnosis according to evidence-based medicine corresponds with this TCM-qualification. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that Danshen is effective in reducing plasma LDL-cholesterol in a subgroup of patients who have &#x0201c;blood stasis&#x0201d; as opposed to the observed increase in plasma LDL-cholesterol in those who are at increased cardiovascular risk according to evidence-based criteria. However, our observed low reproducibility of the observation &#x02018;blood stasis&#x02019; and overpresentation of intermediate test results support our decision not to include this TCM-qualification in the inclusion criteria of this trial.</p><p>In our study Danshen (water extract) actually increased LDL and total cholesterol levels compared to placebo. This increment in cholesterol levels has also been observed for another food product, namely coffee. It has been shown that boiled, but not filtered, coffee increases total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol [<xref rid="pone.0128695.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The hypercholesterolemic factor in boiled coffee is retained by the filter paper and eventually this factor was identified as cafestol [<xref rid="pone.0128695.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128695.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Possibly, the method of preparation of Danshen produced or preserved a &#x0201c;hypercholesterolemic factor&#x0201d; that was not produced by methods used by others.</p><p>Danshen did not reduce endothelium-dependent vasodilation which suggests that the observed increase in LDL cholesterol of approximately 0.3 mmol/l is too small to have a significant impact on cardiovascular risk. Indeed, endothelium-mediated vasodilation predicts cardiovascular disease and is responsive to changes in plasma cholesterol [<xref rid="pone.0128695.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128695.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists&#x02019; (CTT) Collaboration has shown that each 1 mmol/l reduction in LDL cholesterol reduces the absolute risk of major cardiovascular events with 20% [<xref rid="pone.0128695.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. If we intrapolate these epidemiological observations and assume generalizability of our findings, our observed increase of 0.3 mmol/l in LDL cholesterol would translate into a small increment of 7% in absolute risk of cardiovascular disease. Based on the demographic data of our study population and current cardiovascular risk tables available for this Dutch population, absolute 10-year cardiovascular risk of our subjects to develop a cardiovascular event is 19% for male non-smokers and 35% for male smokers. The water extract of Danshen could theoretically increase these risks to 20.3% and 37.5% for male non-smokers and smokers respectively. However, this projected increase in cardiovascular risk may overestimate the real impact of Danshen on cardiovascular risk, since the increase in LDL-cholesterol was not accompanied by a detectable increase in oxidized LDL cholesterol. Therefore, the impact of Danshen on lipid profile was probably too small to be reflected by a detectable change in acetylcholine-induced forearm vasodilation.</p><p>The strength of our study is the randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled design with objective and reproducible endpoints. The cross-over design is potentially limited by carry-over effects. However, we did not detect an order-effect and baseline measurements in blood pressure and plasma lipids did not differ prior to the two treatment periods.</p><sec id="sec030"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Four weeks of treatment with the herbal product Danshen (water extract) slightly increased LDL-cholesterol without affecting a wide variety of other risk markers or endothelium-dependent vasodilation, an early marker of vascular injury. These results do not support the use of Danshen water-extract as a single agent to treat risk factors of atherosclerosis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec031"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0128695.s001"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>The protocol (with final amendements marked as tracked changes) as approved by our ethics committee.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0128695.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0128695.s002"><label>S2 Text</label><caption><title>Funding, role of funders and conflict of interests.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0128695.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0128695.s003"><label>S3 Text</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist of information to include when reporting a randomised trial.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0128695.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0128695.s004"><label>S4 Text</label><caption><title>Methods to detect Blood Stasis.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0128695.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0128695.s005"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Excell file containing the full database for lipids (primary outcome) and blood pressure (secondary outcome).</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0128695.s005.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank G.
