Recently, cardiac autonomic nervous modulation has been proposed as a useful objective indicator of fatigue. However, scientific considerations of the relation between feelings of fatigue and cardiac autonomic nervous modulation while listening to music are still lacking. In this study, we examined which subjective feelings of fatigue are related to participants' cardiac autonomic nervous function while they listen to music. We used an album of comfortable and relaxing environmental music, with blended sounds from a piano and violin as well as natural sound sources. We performed a crossover trial of environmental music and silent sessions for 20 healthy subjects, 12 females, and 8 males, after their daily work shift. We measured changes in eight types of subjective feelings, including healing, fatigue, sleepiness, relaxation, and refreshment, using the KOKORO scale, a subjective mood measurement system for self-reported feelings. Further, we obtained measures of cardiac autonomic nervous function on the basis of heart rate variability before and after the sessions. During the music session, subjective feelings significantly shifted toward healing and a secure/relaxed feeling and these changes were greater than those in the silent session. Heart rates (&#x00394;HR) in the music session significantly decreased compared with those in the silent session. Other cardiac autonomic parameters such as high-frequency (HF) component and the ratio of low-frequency (LF) and HF components (LF/HF) were similar in the two sessions. In the linear regression analysis of the feelings with &#x00394;HR and changes in LF/HF (&#x00394;LF/HF), increases and decreases in &#x00394;HR were correlated to the feeling axes of Fatigue-Healing and Anxiety/Tension&#x02013;Security/Relaxation, whereas those in &#x00394;LF/HF were related to the feeling axes of Sleepiness&#x02013;Wakefulness and Gloomy&#x02013;Refreshed. This indicated that listening to music improved the participants' feelings of fatigue and decreased their heart rates. However, it did not reduce the cardiac LF/HF, suggesting that cardiac LF/HF might show a delayed response to fatigue. Thus, we demonstrated changes in cardiac autonomic nervous functions based on feelings of fatigue.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>subjective feelings</kwd><kwd>fatigue</kwd><kwd>healing</kwd><kwd>music</kwd><kwd>cardiac autonomic function</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="46"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="7591"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Listening to music is generally recognized as a way to regulate people's various feelings and mood/emotional states toward relaxation, sleepiness, motivation, and sadness. Indeed, human feelings are easily transformed by music. Listening to music as therapy reportedly mediates prolonged fatigue and pain reduction (Krout, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Chuang et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Graversen and Sommer, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Archer et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Mercad&#x000ed;e et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and has been widely used to treat people with health and psychiatric disorders worldwide (Lin et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Half the general population in modern society experiences fatigue and its sensations caused by continual stress and prolonged deficiency of rest or sleep (Watanabe and Kuratsune, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Fatigue and its sensations are pre-symptoms described as indicating a deterioration of performance and attentiveness in social activities and work (Watanabe, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). There are a variety of fatigue states such as chronic, physical, mental, complex (a combination of physical and mental fatigue), and inflammatory fatigue resulting from a variety of daily fatigue loadings, and these states are often inconsistent with perception of the fatigue condition. Recently, cardiac autonomic nervous modulation has been proposed as a characteristic feature of mental, acute, and daily levels of fatigue, based on the correlation of scores on the Chalder Fatigue Scale, a common fatigue index (Mizuno et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Tanaka et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), indicating a specific nature of this relationship between cardiac autonomic nervous modulation and fatigue. Moreover, the modulation has been used to assess prolonged fatigue and pain in clinical studies (Logier et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Chuang et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). To this end, to reduce the accumulation of daily fatigue and its sensations, it is effective to control the cardiac autonomic nervous functions through the use of suitable music. Listening to music is practical as it is low-cost and -risk.</p><p>Music expresses various feelings such as healing, relaxation, and arousal, and it prompts heart rate variability (HRV) and autonomic nervous system. Different kinds of music lead to different responses involving these feelings. For example, rock and heavy metal music are often used to create arousal, particularly among the youth. The autonomic nervous system, combined with the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, largely acts unconsciously and regulates various bodily functions such as heart rate, digestion, respiratory rate, and pupillary response. In recent times, the concept of autonomic nervous modulation has been applied to healthcare management in various fields other than medical treatment (Lucini et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Singh et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Sakuragi and Sugiyama, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Mizuno et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Tanaka et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and to the risk management of diseases such as arrhythmia and cardiovascular disease (Zimmerman et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; Barutcu et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Zafrir et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Autonomic nervous activation in a large range of emotions was previously reported. Emotion is a specific and strong feeling, such as anger, anxiety, fear, sadness, and happiness. It causes changes in subjective feeling quality, expressive behavior, and physiological activation (Kreibig, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). However, there is still no scientific consensus on the distinct patterns of autonomic nervous activation and/or modulation across physiological outcome variables allowing for the identification of an emotional state. Thus, it still remains unclear which subjective feelings of fatigue, including healing, fatigue, sleepiness, and a refreshed feeling, are quantitatively correlated to cardiac autonomic nervous functions while when a person listening to music.</p><p>It has not adequately been shown how subjective feelings of fatigue are affected by environmental music or how these feelings are related to the cardiac autonomic nervous modulations in the body. In this study, we recruited office workers as participants and examined their subjective feelings as affected by environmental music, after their daily work shift ended. We attempted to monitor real-time subtle changes in their subjective feelings and states of mind using the KOKORO scale, a frequently used, self-reporting subjective mood measurement system on smartphones and/or tablet devices. The system can easily record subtle changes in subjective feelings as a person listens to music. We measured cardiac autonomic nervous modulations from HRV, one of the fatigue indexes, before and after the sessions. Next, we investigated the relation between the participants' subjective feelings of fatigue and cardiac autonomic nervous modulations while they listened to environmental music.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Experimental design</title><p>In all, 20 healthy participants [34 &#x000b1; 5.4 years of age (mean &#x000b1; SDM), 12 females and 8 males] were enrolled. All experiments were performed after the participants' daily work shift (i.e., after 5 p.m.). All the participants underwent both environmental music and silent sessions. The environmental music was provided by Della Inc. (Tokyo, Japan) and is now commercially available. The environmental music album used in the experiment was composed by Mitsuhiro. It consisted of comfortable and relaxing music with blended sounds from a piano, violin, harp, acoustic guitar, and synthesizer. Some of the music included natural sound sources such as breeze, rushing creeks, and birdsongs, which are thought to bring about relief.</p><p>A crossover trial of environmental music and silent sessions was performed three times for each participant. Each experimental period in either type of session lasted 30 min, and all experiments for each participant were conducted over 6 days. In both the sessions, the participants' subjective feelings were evaluated every 5 min, for a total of seven times, including 2 min at the beginning of each session, using the KOKORO scale (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). For 5 min before and after each session, cardiac autonomic nervous modulations were measured using a Fatigue Measurement Device: from &#x02212;7 to &#x02212;2 and 30 to 35 min, on the basis of a zero point at the beginning of each session (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Whether the participants were listening to environmental music or silence, they wore noise-canceling headphones in each experiment. The study was performed in a quiet room. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Center for Health Science Innovation (Osaka City University), and all the participants provided written informed consent. We paid a participation honorarium to each subject.

Various indexes of autonomic nervous control, including the basis of an interbeat interval (IBI), heart rates (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), standard deviation of the interbeat intervals (SDNN), root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), mean of the absolute value of the difference between successive interbeat intervals (MSD), mean square successive difference (MSSD), respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), cardiac sympathetic index (CSI), and cardiac vagal index (CVI) were reported (Allen et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). In many studies of fatigue, parameters of low-frequency (LF) component, high-frequency (HF) component, and LF/HF were used for the indexes of cardiac autonomic nervous modulation (Tanaka et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Mizuno et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Park et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Sommerfeldt et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Leti and Bricout, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Yu et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Schmitt et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Vigo et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). LF and HF components indicate the cardiac autonomic nervous modulations likely influenced by the parasympathetic nervous system (Houle and Billman, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Reyes del Paso et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>In this study, a Fatigue Measurement Device VM302 (Hitachi Systems, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was used to evaluate changes in the cardiac autonomic nervous functions of each participant. We used ECG signals and evaluated cardiac autonomic nervous modulations by an indirect measurement of cardiac autonomic nerve activity. When ECG was missing, photoplethysmography was used for the calculations. During the measurement of cardiac autonomic nervous function, the participants remained at rest, and kept their eyes closed.</p><p>By monitoring HRV in ECG, we collected the 5 min data of cardiac autonomic nervous function with a 600 Hz sample rate. The built-in firmware in VM302 detected the R wave peaks using an algorithm of peak detection based on a hill-climbing method, and the obtained peak time on R waves was transmitted to an external computer. From each R peak time, a time series of R-R intervals was sequentially generated. Noise of digital signals was removed using a low pass filter, whereas a removal of linear trends for R-R intervals was not performed in the measurements.</p><p>We extracted 30 s of R-R interval sequences from the 5 min collected data in every heart beat event after 30 s: Total number of extracted sequences were &#x0201c;total number of heart beats in 5 min&#x0201d; minus &#x0201c;the heart beat number in the beginning 30 s.&#x0201d; The collected data were analyzed using MemCalc/Win (GMS Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The heart rate (HR) was calculated from the inverse of R-R intervals in each heart beat. Frequency analyses for R-R interval variation were performed with the maximum entropy method (MEM), which is capable of estimating the power spectrum density from short time series data and is adequate for examining changes in HRV in different conditions of short duration (Takusagawa et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Kanaya et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). In addition, instead of a stationary test of R-R intervals fluctuation, outliers in the 30 s data of R-R intervals were defined as different values by 0.75-fold lower and 1.75-fold higher of the median values of R-R intervals for 30 s, and the matched data of R-R intervals was removed.</p><p>The power spectral density obtained after MEM was divided into LF component, within the range of 0.04&#x02013;0.15 Hz, and HF component, within the range of 0.15&#x02013;0.4 Hz. The mean values of HR, LF, HF, and LF/HF obtained in each time series were calculated as representative values in each measurement. Changes in cardiac autonomic nervous modulations, such as &#x00394;HR, &#x00394;LF, &#x00394;HF, and &#x00394;LF/HF, were calculated as differences between before and after the sessions for each participant.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>We designed three-time crossover experiments (totaling six experiments) for each participant. Representative values for each participant in the sessions were obtained by the mean of the three experiments. Outliers in the obtained dataset were defined as the points that were different from lower and upper quartiles by 1.5-fold lower and higher values of the interquartile range, respectively, and the outlier data were removed from further analysis.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using the <italic>R</italic> statistics platform (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org">http://www.r-project.org</ext-link>; R Core Team, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).

Cardiac autonomic nervous functions were examined by spectral frequency domain analysis of RR-intervals in ECG. Changes in HR represent a balance of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. In addition to HR, we calculated LF, HF, and LF/HF as other indexes of cardiac autonomic nervous modulations. LF and HF have been discussed to likely relate to the parasympathetic nervous systems (Reyes del Paso et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) by some experiments: Physiological measurements including blood pressure, respiration, and autonomic nervous discharge indicate that HF component is mainly mediated by parasympathetic nervous modulation (Malliani et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>); pharmacological blockade of the vagal nerve remarkably reduces LF component (Pomeranz et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>); sympathetic blockade has no significant effects on LF component (Taylor et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>); LF component is determined mainly by the parasympathetic nervous system in cardiac regulations (Reyes del Paso et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrated that subjective feelings from fatigue to healing were improved by the participants' listening to environmental music (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The examination of subjective feelings revealed non-significant gender differences in the male and female participants (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Further, cardiac autonomic nervous modulations, such as &#x00394;LF, &#x00394;HF, and &#x00394;LF/HF did not show any significant changes between the music and silent sessions (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B&#x02013;D</xref>), but &#x00394;HR values after the music sessions were significantly decreased (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). We found that the changes in subjective feelings of fatigue while listening to music are apparently correlated with those in &#x00394;HR and &#x00394;LF/HF as cardiac physiological responses (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). These results indicated that listening to the environmental music improved the participants' feelings of fatigue accompanied by sensitive decreases in heart rates, whereas it did not reduce cardiac LF/HF. This difference might show a delayed cardiac autonomic nervous response to fatigue.</p><p>Several previous studies have demonstrated that listening to music was effective in improving mood, decreasing anxiety, and increasing self-rated relaxation (Davis and Thaut, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>). Also, several pleasant types of music and/or silence subjectively induced higher relaxation and comfort, as well as lower fatigue, compared to unpleasant music (Krout, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Hirokawa and Ohira, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Iwanaga et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Chuang et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Mercad&#x000ed;e et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). When participants listened to relaxing and comforting music, HR was significantly lower than when they listened to exciting music (Nater et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Moreover, the HF component was higher for sedative music than for excitative music, similar to that for silence (Iwanaga et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). These results are almost consistent with those of the present study. Taken together, the results suggest that listening to environmental music is effective for improving subjective feelings, such as fatigue, and for maintaining mental healing and a refreshed feeling.</p><p>Furthermore, we examined which subjective feelings of fatigue, including healing, fatigue, sleepiness, and a refreshed feeling, were quantitatively correlated to cardiac autonomic nervous modulations when the participants listened to music. We found a significant correlation of &#x00394;HR with the feelings of Fatigue&#x02013;Healing and Anxiety/Tension&#x02013;Security/Relaxation in the music session but not in the silent session (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Also, our results suggested that the variations in cardiac nervous variability, especially patterns of LF/HF and HF, are predictive of changes in subjective feelings. In the classes defined in this study, variations of changes in subjective feelings were observed; decreases in &#x00394;LF/HF contribute to increases in healing and refreshed feelings and decreases in sleepiness feeling (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The linear-regression analysis of &#x00394;LF/HF during the music session suggested that the changes from wakefulness to sleepiness and from gloomy to refreshed feeling mainly contributed to cardiac autonomic nervous functions. Indeed, these results might point to the prediction of cardiac autonomic nervous modulations during listening to music through the monitoring and quantifying of various subjective feelings. It was previously reported that in the respective relations between fatigue and cardiac autonomic nervous function, LF and the LF/HF ratio were positively correlated with the daily level of fatigue, as evaluated by the Chalder Fatigue Scale (Tanaka et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In addition, HF was negatively correlated with fatigue score. Another study showed that both the visual analog scale score for fatigue sensation and the LF/HF ratio after an 8 h fatigue session inducing mental fatigue significantly increased, compared to before the session, in addition to which the HF component after the fatigue session significantly decreased (Mizuno et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In the case of participants with chronic fatigue syndrome, who show substantial fatigue unrelieved by rest, cardiac autonomic parameters were reported to be strong predictors of stress levels and subjective sensations of fatigue (Boneva et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Burton et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Taken together, the reduction in fatigue sensations as a result of listening to the music is associated with the parasympathetic predominance in the cardiac autonomic nervous system.</p><p>On the contrary, our results also suggest the relation of sleepiness to cardiac autonomic nervous functions. Sleepiness and sleep quality are known to relate both to the LF/HF ratio and the HF component; increasing the LF/HF ratio and decreasing HF parameters significantly during sleep lead to low sleep quality (Burton et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). This suggests the correlation of relevant mental variables with sleep quality and cardiac autonomic nervous dysfunction. Thus, in the music session, feelings of sleepiness together with the imbalance of cardiac autonomic nervous modulations may suppress mental healing and refreshed feelings. The imbalance of cardiac autonomic nervous modulations may be considered to refer to the accumulation of daily stimulation for cardiac autonomic nervous function and unmatched music with each pasted memory or taste. Our data may provide a future challenge to the understanding of the relations between subjective feelings and cardiac autonomic nervous modulations in daily life. Further, we would like to try to evaluate cardiac autonomic nervous modulations using other autonomic indexes such as IBI, SDNN, RMSSD, MSD, MSSD, RSA, CSI, and CVI in future studies of fatigue.</p><p>The environmental music used in this study improved subjective feelings related to fatigue and anxiety/tension in almost all participants. The classification of the variability of cardiac autonomic nervous modulations allowed us to obtain the variation in subjective feelings. In the simple linear regression analysis, we found a correlation of subjective feelings with some cardiac autonomic nervous modulations during the participants' time listening to music. This suggested an expectation of changes in cardiac autonomic nervous functions based on the subjective feelings of fatigue. Our study allows us to consider health management through the evaluation of the variability of the cardiac autonomic nervous system and to quantify variation in subjective sensations.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Conceived and designed the study: YK.
