Each participant completed six exercise sessions, consisting of three exercise modalities: aerobic endurance exercise (AEE), high-intensity interval running (HIIT), and high-intensity resistance training (HIRT); and two acute nutritional interventions: CHO and PRO. Salivary samples were collected before each exercise session to determine estradiol-&#x003b2;-17 and before and after to quantify cortisol. Post-exercise REE and RER were analyzed via indirect calorimetry at the following: baseline, immediately post (IP), 30 minutes (30 min) post, and 60 minutes (60 min) post exercise.

In addition, 75% of normal weight women believe they are overweight and 90% overestimate their body size [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. With such high obesity and body dissatisfaction rates, it is important for women to receive reliable health and weight loss recommendations. In addition, lack of time has shifted the focus on more practical time-efficient strategies for exercise.</p><p id="P6">For health and weight maintenance, aerobic endurance exercise (AEE) is usually prescribed [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, more recently, higher-intensity exercise modalities have been suggested as more time-efficient strategies for improvements in health and energy expenditure [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Post-exercise resting energy expenditure (REE) has been reported to increase following a 20-min treadmill run [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], while high-intensity interval training (HIIT) has increased total caloric energy expenditure (EE) in half the time [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In addition, high-intensity resistance training (HIRT) with short rest intervals has been shown to enhance post-exercise REE above that seen with more commonly prescribed resistance training [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] of lesser intensity and longer rest periods. While these three common exercise modes seem to be successful at expending calories, previous research has indicated that high-intensity exercise stimulates similar increases in post-exercise REE in comparison to lower intensity exercise, in half the time [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Research is still conflicted on whether aerobic or resistance exercise is more effective for augmenting EE. Higher intensity exercise has also been linked to higher rates of fat oxidation, measured by respiratory exchange ratio (RER) [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p id="P7">The combined effect of varying exercise modalities and pre-workout nutrition on energy substrate utilization and EE in women is limited. Pre-exercise ingestion of protein (PRO) has been found to increase post-exercise REE more than that of pre-exercise ingestion of carbohydrate (CHO) [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. While women rely heavily on fat as an energy substrate during exercise, previous data has demonstrated the importance of pre-exercise feedings on augmenting lipolysis [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition, a higher rate of fat oxidation in women than men in the fasted state, but not in the postprandial state, has been reported [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Pre-exercise nutrient timing and content may be important when evaluating exercise substrate utilization in women.</p><p id="P8">When evaluating exercise and nutritional responses in women, it is important to consider hormonal variances, such as the sex-specific hormone estradiol that varies throughout the menstrual cycle. Estradiol has been shown to have an impact on REE [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Controlling for estradiol concentrations in metabolic evaluations is crucial for determining the practical effects an intervention may have [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. High-intensity aerobic exercise has been shown to stimulate increases in cortisol [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], a stress hormone that regulates energy substrate utilization by mobilizing amino acids from skeletal muscle and promoting gluconeogenic activity [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Elevated cortisol concentrations have been reported as a primary hormonal factor augmenting exercise adaptations from high-intensity exercise, as well as impacting rates of lipolysis [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p id="P9">To date, no investigations have evaluated the combined effects of varying exercise modalities and acute nutritional supplementation in women. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to examine the effect of common exercise modalities, AEE, HIIT, and HIRT, combined with pre-exercise CHO or PRO ingestion, on post-exercise REE and RER in women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Experimental design</title><p id="P10">To test the study hypotheses, a randomized, crossover, factorial design was used.

Participants performed each exercise mode twice, with a different nutritional intervention each time. Salivary samples were collected before each exercise session to determine estradiol and cortisol concentrations and after each exercise session to determine cortisol concentrations. Exercise sessions were performed at the same time of day, within 2 h, with at least 48 h between each session, and the order was randomly assigned using random allocation software (version 1.0.0; Isfahan, Iran).

The study protocol was approved by the University&#x02019;s Institutional Review Board, and all procedures followed were in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008. Prior to participation, all participants provided written informed consent and completed a health history questionnaire. To be included in this study, participants had to be a woman between the ages of 18 and 35 and be recreationally active, defined as accumulating 1 to 5 h per week of aerobic and/or resistance exercise, excluding competitive athletes.

Resting heart rate (RHR) was measured using a polar heart rate monitor (Polar FT1, Polar USA, Port Washington, NY, USA), while age-predicted maximal heart rate (MHR) was determined. Exercise target heart rate (THR) was calculated using the Karvonen equation [THR = ((MHR &#x02212; RHR) % intensity) + MHR] [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].

The device uses rectilinear fan beam acquisition to give a three-compartment assessment of body composition, including fat mass (FM), lean mass (LM), and percent body fat (% fat). After removing all metal objects, subjects laid supine in the middle of the platform with hands facedown near their sides. Subjects were instructed to remain still and breathe normally for the duration of the scan. All scans were performed by the same DEXA-certified technician. The device was calibrated according to the manufacturer recommendations before testing to ensure valid results.

After a 5-min warm-up and light stretching, participants were familiarized with the equipment and the motion of the movements. Each participant then performed eight to ten repetitions at 50% of their predicted 1RM. After a 1-min rest period, each participant performed four to six repetitions at 80% of their predicted 1RM. Following a 1-min rest period, the weight was increased to an estimated 1RM load, which participants lifted one time. After each successful set of one repetition, the weight was increased until a failed attempt occurred, within four attempts. Two to three minutes of rest was given between 1RM attempts.</p><p id="P15">After the 1RM tests, participants performed a multiple-RM strength test for four accessory exercises: alternating stationary lunge, overhead shoulder press, biceps curls, and overhead triceps extension. With free weights and a spotter, participants performed each exercise with a weight they could lift for one set of no less than three, and no more than ten repetitions. The weight for each exercise, set by the lab assistants, was based on each participant&#x02019;s past strength training experience. If the participant was unable to perform the exercise for three repetitions or was able to perform more than ten repetitions, the weight was decreased or increased, respectively, and the test was redone.

To ensure valid saliva collection results, participants were asked to avoid drinking alcohol for 12 h and eating a major meal for 3 h prior to giving saliva samples. Participants were asked to rinse their mouth with water 10 min prior to saliva collection, to remove food residue. To avoid blood in saliva collections, participants were asked to avoid brushing teeth for 45 min and obtaining dental work for 48 h prior to giving saliva samples. All samples were maintained at 4&#x000b0;C no longer than necessary before freezing them at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C. Intra-assay precision coefficient of variation (CV) for estrogen was 8.7% to 18.6%; inter-assay precision CV was 3.9%.

The current study is the first to compare common exercise modalities, with acute nutritional intake, on post-exercise REE and RER in women. Results of the current study indicate that HIIT produces a significantly higher REE than AEE up to 60 min post exercise and a significantly higher post-exercise REE than HIRT IP exercise; while AEE and HIRT produced similar post-exercise REE responses. HIIT and HIRT both also stimulated greater fat utilization (via a lower RER) when compared to AEE. In the current study, ingesting PRO prior to exercise produced an increased post-exercise resting energy expenditure, compared to CHO consumption. PRO ingestion also resulted in significantly augmented fat utilization 30 and 60 min post exercise.</p><sec id="S26"><title>REE</title><p id="P36">As hypothesized, a single bout of HIIT produced a significantly higher post-exercise REE than AEE through 60 min post exercise (<italic>&#x00394;</italic>= 189.2 kcal/day). Similar to the current study, higher post-exercise net EE with high-intensity short-duration cycling (75% VO<sub>2max</sub>) compared to shorter and longer durations at a low intensity (50% VO<sub>2max</sub>) has been found in men [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], indicating that exercise intensity affects the magnitude and duration of excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). HIIT&#x02019;s metabolic inefficiency has been contributed to rapid changes in skeletal muscle oxidative capacity due to the high level of muscle fiber recruitment, particularly in type II fibers [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In contrast to the current study, bouts of 60 s of work with 60 s rest, at 90% VO<sub>2max</sub>, have been found to have the same total net EE as 20-min bouts at 70% VO<sub>2max</sub> [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Perhaps the difference in exercise intensities for the two sessions was not substantial enough to elicit significant differences, such as those found in the current study. Additionally, it is unclear if differences between exercise intensities were controlled for [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Subjects in the present study completed 30 min, instead of 20 min, of AEE in order to closely match EE during HIIT (determined during pilot testing; unpublished data).</p><p id="P37">In contrast to our hypothesis, when compared to HIIT, REE from HIRT was significantly lower from baseline to IP exercise (<italic>&#x00394;</italic>= &#x02212;169.3 kcal/day), with no differences at 30 and 60 min post exercise. Additionally, there was no difference between AEE and HIRT (<italic>&#x00394;</italic>= 19.8 kcal/day). Research that has examined REE differences between AEE or HIIT and HIRT is limited. However, single bouts of resistance training and running performed at the same intensity have both resulted in elevated REE up to 10 h post exercise [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Contrary to the current study, total body circuit weight training (three sets of 15 repetitions at 65% 1RM) has been shown to elicit a higher post-exercise REE in women than a treadmill run matched for aerobic energy cost [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The current study also matched EE demands of AEE and HIRT during pilot testing, with HIRT being slightly lower, yet at a higher intensity than that of Braun et al. [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Post-exercise REE data from the current study eludes to exercise intensity, instead of duration, as the primary determinant of EPOC variance, similar to several studies [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Collectively, it seems as if HIIT is the most time-effective exercise modality for increasing EE in women.</p><p id="P38">Combined acute PRO feedings with exercise resulted in a significantly higher REE for PRO than for CHO up to 60 min post exercise (<italic>&#x00394;</italic>= 59.3 kcal/day). This is similar to previous findings [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] that demonstrate greater post-exercise REE and fat oxidation following a pre-exercise meal or snack with higher PRO content. The increase in post-exercise REE with PRO ingestion can be contributed to PRO&#x02019;s thermic effect of food, which is higher and more prolonged than that of CHO and fat [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

Consuming an additional 100 kcal of PRO prior to exercise, as done in the current study, may increase EE up to an hour after exercise.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>RER</title><p id="P39">Exercise intensity has previously been shown to be a driving factor for energy substrate utilization during and after exercise. Immediately after HIIT, RER was significantly increased compared to AEE, indicating a higher utilization of CHO during and immediately after exercise. Within 25 min afterward, RER was significantly lower than AEE (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), demonstrating higher fat utilization, which was maintained up to 60 min post. Similar to the current study, previous studies have reported a significantly lower RER post exercise with repeated bouts of moderate intensity cycling, compared to a single bout [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and a lower RER with a lower vs. higher intensity cycle bout (50% and 70% VO<sub>2max</sub>) through 3 h post exercise, indicating increased fat utilization [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Previous data demonstrates differing exercise intensity can augment post-exercise REE and fat oxidation, but intervals do not produce differences compared to continuous exercise if total EE, duration, and intensity between the two remain the same throughout the exercise bout. In contrast to the current study, exercise bouts at 45% and 65% VO<sub>2max</sub> resulted in similar RER values when EE of exercise was matched [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Although diets were kept constant, residual effects of pre-exercise meals could cause similar RER values, since a fasting period of only 2 h was implemented prior to exercise.</p><p id="P40">During the post-exercise period, oxygen consumption is elevated for a period of time as a result of homeostasis disruption caused by exercise. Physiological changes, such as those in cellular ion concentrations, tissue temperatures, and metabolite and hormone levels, take place into recovery, disabling oxygen consumption to lower back to resting levels [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This process of EPOC is related to exercise duration and intensity and can be influenced by sex-based hormones (estrogen) and macronutrient availability, among other things [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. CHO is the primary fuel used during moderate- to high-intensity exercise; but post exercise, the body shifts from CHO to lipid energy sources, which lowers RER [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The current study demonstrates the fuel shift within 25 min post exercise, indicating greater post-exercise fat utilization with HIIT. When comparing HIIT and HIRT, RER was significantly higher IP, significantly lower at 30 min, but similar 60 min after exercise. RER was lower for HIRT than AEE at 30 (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and 60 min post exercise (<italic>p</italic> = 0.027). Little research has compared RER between aerobic and resistance training, but investigations that have been done present conflicting results. In contrast to this study, no post-exercise differences in RER were found between a 60-min circuit weight training bout (four sets of ten repetitions, 70% 1RM) and a cycling bout (70% VO<sub>2max</sub>) in men [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Similar to the current study, a lower RER was demonstrated 22 h after HIRT compared to more traditional resistance training (four sets of 8 to 12 repetitions, 1- to 2-min rest) [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In relation to sex, no differences were reported in post-circuit weight training RER between men and women [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It is important to examine the menstrual cycle due to the effects estrogen may have on energy substrate utilization, as the mid-luteal phase is characterized by high estrogen levels, which can enhance lipid utilization with exercise in women [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p id="P41">In the present study, no differences were found in RER between CHO and PRO IP exercise; but supporting our hypothesis, RER was significantly decreased for PRO compared to CHO at 30 min (<italic>&#x00394;</italic>= 0.036; <italic>p</italic> = 0.001) and 60 min post exercise (<italic>&#x00394;</italic>= 0.052; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Similarly, higher fat oxidation has been reported with a low CHO diet compared to a moderate CHO diet at 1 h post exercise [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Substrate oxidation can be influenced by substrate availability from dietary intake and physical activity. While this study only evaluated acute feedings, low CHO diets have been shown to decrease circulating insulin levels, which promotes fatty acid utilization in skeletal muscle [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], perhaps supporting the lower RER for PRO ingestion in the current study.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Dietary intake</title><p id="P42">Chronic dietary manipulations have an impact on substrate utilization. Based on 3-day diet logs, participants consumed on average 48.8% CHO, 16.8% PRO, and 34.2% fat daily. Although intakes were within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for Americans, average baseline PRO intake was 1.3 g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (0.5 g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> higher than the Recommended Dietary Allowance) [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Interestingly, while average PRO intake was relatively high, an additional acute feeding of 25 g of PRO significantly augmented REE in the current study, perhaps supporting the suggestion that higher protein needs (1.63 g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) may be necessary for women to maintain nitrogen balance [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. While the importance of chronic dietary manipulations is apparent, the current study supports the benefit of acute PRO feedings on EE, in healthy women eating within dietary guidelines. Acute pre-exercise feedings have positively influenced fat oxidation, in comparison to a fasted state that blunted fat oxidation [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Future long-term studies identifying the acute effects on weight loss and body composition improvements in women would be valuable.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Limitations</title><p id="P43">A limitation in the current study was the use of indirect calorimetry to measure REE and RER, rather than whole body direct calorimetry, which is considered the gold standard. Also, excluding the acute PRO and CHO supplementation, no dietary modifications were made, which could have a potential effect on the acute RER measurement. However, because no modifications were made, the study results may be more practical for a woman who only wants to change her pre-workout nutrition rather than her whole diet. In addition, since this was an acute intervention, and post-exercise measurements were only conducted for 60 min, it is difficult to predict longer term EE and energy substrate utilization. Specifically, EE calculations extrapolate our 60-min findings to a 24-h period (using Weir et al. [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] equation), potentially elevating the actual caloric differences (i.e. approximately 800 kcal). Future research should focus on determining the effects of chronic exercise and nutrition modifications in women using whole body calorimetry.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S30"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P44">This study indicates that HIIT elicited the largest increase in post-exercise REE, as well as augmented RER, compared to AEE and HIRT. Immediately post exercise, there was a heightened caloric effect from the HIIT bout stimulating approximately 800 kcal/day more than HIRT and AEE. Beginning around 30 min post exercise, HIIT and HIRT both had a higher fat utilization than AEE; at 60 min post, HIIT and HIRT resulted in similar energy substrate utilization in comparison to each other. In combination with varying exercise modalities, PRO intake elevated post-exercise REE and fat oxidation to a greater extent than CHO. PRO ingestion prior to exercise may help further maximize the caloric effect, with an additional approximately 90 kcal/day expended compared to CHO. Around 30 min post exercise, PRO increased fat utilization compared to CHO. Collectively, these findings suggest a potential benefit of integrating HIIT and pre-exercise PRO intake into exercise routines. Specifically in women, this strategy may have positive implications on their health, weight, and body composition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S32"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental file</label><caption><p id="P45"><bold>Additional file 1: Appendix 1.</bold> REE (kcal/day) for each modality and time (mean &#x000b1; SD). <bold>Appendix 2.</bold> RER for each modality, treatment, and time (mean &#x000b1; SD).</p></caption><media xlink:href="NIHMS702758-supplement-Supplemental_file.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e1030" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S33"><p>This study was supported by the National Strength and Conditioning Association Foundation.
