The disease acquired tremendous significance in this era of commercialization due to changes in lifestyle, stress, indiscriminate use of topical ocular drugs, preservative induced damage, laser surgeries, and occupations requiring extended periods of attention (visual display terminal syndrome) besides the hazardous effects of certain systemic drugs. Studies show its prevalence ranging from 14.6% to 28%.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Incidence increases linearly with advancing age.</p><p>Dry eye is defined as &#x0201c;a multifactorial disease of the tears and ocular surface that results in symptoms of discomfort, visual disturbance, and tears film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface.&#x0201d; It is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear film and inflammation of the ocular surface&#x0201d;.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] <italic>Shushkakshipaka</italic>, an etymologically similar entity, has been described in Ayurvedic texts whose etio-pathogenesis and clinical features of dryness and inflammation of the ocular surface remarkably correlate with that of DES. <italic>Shushkakshipaka</italic> is a <italic>Sarvagata Roga</italic>, that is, disease affecting all parts of the eye; a <italic>Vataja</italic> or <italic>Vata-Pittaja/Vata-Raktaja</italic> curable disease.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] While the description in Sushruta Samhita demarcates the early stage, Vagbhatta Samhitas give details of a fully-fledged picture including <italic>Paka</italic> (inflammatory) stage of the disease.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Dry eye can be classified into two types, evaporative (tear sufficient), and tear deficient. In tear deficient dry eyes, there is disorder of lacrimal gland to secrete or transfer fluid to the conjunctival sac. In tear sufficient (evaporative) dry eyes, there is increased evaporation of tear fluid from the ocular surface.</p><p>The spectrum of complaints found in dry eye in order of frequency includes foreign body sensation (gritty feeling), excessive secretion, burning, redness, photophobia, blurred vision, itching, and pain. Patients with severe filamentary keratitis may complain of severe pain brought on by blinking. Surprisingly, patients seldom complain that their eyes are dry, although some may report a lack of emotional tears or a deficient response to irritation stimuli.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] There may be crusting of eyelids and sticking, which is commonly seen in the morning on waking up. Nonspecific symptoms include headache, heaviness of eyes, or tiredness.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Patients can have considerable discomfort with this affliction, which can interfere with normal daily functioning.</p><p>Signs of dry eye include tear film abnormalities like an increase in mucous strands and debris in early stage of the disease. The marginal tear meniscus is found to be concave, small, and in severe cases, it may be absent altogether. In normal eyes, the meniscus is convex and about 1 mm high at lower lid margin.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Less than 0.5 mm meniscus height is indicative of tear deficiency.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Corneal abnormalities are observed in moderate to severe cases, e.g. punctate epitheliopathy involving the inferior cornea,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] filamentary keratopathy, and mucous plaques. Conjunctival congestion, corneal surface irregularities, blink disorders, and associated blepharitis may also be observed.</p><p>Despite a number of researches being carried out, no curative treatment for DES has been achieved. Only palliative measures in the form of tear replacement therapy with a variety of artificial tear solutions are available which are to be used for lifelong by the patients, further burdening them financially. Palliative measures also fail to alleviate the symptoms later on due to preservative induced damage to the epithelial lining and basic secretors.</p><p>Ayurvedic texts enlist a number of treatment modalities for treatment of the disease, including both localized and systemic measures. In view of the magnitude of the problem, this study was undertaken to achieve cost-effective treatment modalities of Ayurveda in treating this chronic ailment.

It has been described as a <italic>Vata</italic> or <italic>Vata-Pittaja</italic> eye disorder affecting all parts of the eye which is curable by medical means. It is clear from the etymological derivation of the <italic>Sushkakhipaka</italic> that the disease can occur in two ways, viz., either by absent or decreased secretion of tears or their altered coherence with the ocular surface resulting in <italic>Paka</italic> (inflammation) of the <italic>Netra</italic>. Similar classification of dry eye in two broad categories of tear deficient and tear sufficient dry eye is in vogue in modern ophthalmological literature. Whereas the abstraction of tear is described vividly in modern literature, it is not so in texts of Ayurveda. To ascertain the Ayurvedic concept of fluids which bathe the ocular surface, a thorough search was done which yielded that though no structure was linked with the formation of <italic>Ashru</italic> in Ayurveda, the ancient sages knew the importance of tear fluid very well and drainage pathway of lacrimal system was known to them. It was concluded from the evidences scattered in Ayurvedic literature that <italic>Ashru</italic> is derived from the <italic>Rasa Dhatu</italic>, and its functions in the eye are similar to that of <italic>Rasa Dhatu</italic> in the body. It restores the wear and tear and provides nutrition to the outer tunics. It lubricates the eye and keeps the eye wet.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p><italic>Ashru</italic> can be broadly divided into 3 categories of <italic>Vyapta Ashru</italic>, <italic>Ashru Vega</italic>, and <italic>Ashru Srava</italic>. Another ocular secretion <italic>Netra Vita</italic> is also inherently concerned with the stability of the <italic>Ashru</italic> on the ocular surface.</p><p>A number of treatment modalities has been described in Ayurveda for the management of <italic>Sushkakshipaka</italic>. It not only includes localized measures, but also systemic use of drugs has also been indicated. This variety of treatment modalities points toward the diverse pathology of the disease.</p><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Clinical profile</title><p>Majority of the patients were in the age group 41&#x02013;60 years followed by age group of 60 years and above indicating decline in tear production with age. Majority of patients were housewives of postmenopausal age reflecting toward role of hormonal changes in the causation of DES. Most of the patients registered in this study were Hindu of rural habitat signifying predominance of this community in the area where the trial was conducted. Most of the patients were having <italic>Vata-Pittaja Prakriti</italic> and as the disease is <italic>Vata-Pitta</italic> dominating, the person with similar <italic>Prakriti</italic> is more prone to develop this disease. Thus, the disease was a challenge to treat due to the similarity in <italic>Kala</italic> (age group affected), <italic>Prakriti</italic> (<italic>Vata-Pittaja Prakriti</italic> of the patients) and <italic>Dosha</italic> (<italic>Vata-Pittaja</italic> disease) besides being of <italic>Dvidoshaja</italic> nature.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Maximum number of patients had <italic>Avara Dehabala</italic> followed closely by <italic>Madhyam Dehabala</italic>. It can be ascribed to the age (middle and old age) group affected by this disease in which <italic>Pitta</italic> and <italic>Vata</italic> show their predominance, respectively.</p><p>As CMC does not alter the mechanism of tear secretions and merely provide lubrication, the results in the standard group confirm to the properties of tear substitutes.</p><p>Owing to <italic>Rasakriya</italic> (ointment) form of trial drug, transient blurring, and stuck eyelids are a natural consequence of drug application.
