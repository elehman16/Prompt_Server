This work compared bioavailability of one generic tablet formulation with innovator&#x02019;s product. Both were fixed dose combination tablet formulations containing artemether and lumefantrine.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology</title><p>The study was conducted in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, in which a survey of the most abundant generic containing artemether-lumefantrine tablet formulation was carried out in retail pharmacies. The most widely available generic (Artefan&#x000ae;, Ajanta Pharma Ltd, Maharashtra, India) was sampled for bioavailability comparison with Coartem&#x000ae; (Novartis Pharma, Basel, Switzerland) - the innovator&#x02019;s product. A randomized, two-treatment cross-over study was conducted in 18 healthy Tanzanian black male volunteers. Each volunteer received Artefan&#x000ae; (test) and Coartem&#x000ae; (as reference) formulation separated by 42&#x000a0;days of drug-free washout period. Serial blood samples were collected up to 168&#x000a0;hours after oral administration of a single dose of each treatment. Quantitation of lumefantrine plasma levels was done using HPLC with UV detection. Bioequivalence of the two products was assessed in accordance with the US Food and Drug Authority (FDA) guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The most widely available generic in pharmacies was Artefan&#x000ae; from India. All eighteen enrolled volunteers completed the study and both test and reference tablet formulations were well tolerated. It was possible to quantify lumefantrine alone, therefore, the pharmacokinetic parameters reported herein are for lumefantrine. The geometric mean ratios for C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>0-t</sub> and AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub> were 84% in all cases and within FDA recommended bioequivalence limits of 80% &#x02013; 125%, but the 90% confidence intervals were outside FDA recommended limits (CI 49&#x02013;143%, 53 - 137%, 52 - 135% respectively). There were no statistical significant differences between the two formulations with regard to PK parameters (P&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although the ratios of AUCs and C<sub>max</sub> were within the acceptable FDA range, bioequivalence between Artefan&#x000ae; and Coartem&#x000ae; tablet formulations was not demonstrated due to failure to comply with the FDA 90% confidence interval criteria. Based on the observed total drug exposure (AUCs), Artefan&#x000ae; is likely to produce a similar therapeutic response as Coartem&#x000ae;.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Bioavailability</kwd><kwd>Bioequivalence</kwd><kwd>Artefan</kwd><kwd>Coartem</kwd><kwd>Generics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Malaria is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) especially in children below five years of age. Chemotherapy is the cornerstone in the management of malaria in endemic areas. Due to high resistance rates against sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) containing artemether-lumefantrine (Alu) replaced SP as first-line drug of choice for treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in many countries of SSA, including Tanzania.</p><p>The change of malaria treatment guidelines has been accompanied by infiltration of generic Alu tablet formulation in the health systems of these countries. High prices of branded products e.g. Coartem&#x000ae; calls for alternative cheaper generic products. Generic formulations are promoted to address accessibility and affordability. Unfortunately, there have been disappointing reports of marketing anti-malarial generic products that are fake, substandard and with low bioavailability in South East Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], SSA and East Africa including Kenya and Tanzania [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The use of poor quality anti-malarial drugs threatens the life span of ACT and may result in sub-therapeutic concentrations leading to poor treatment outcomes and emergence of drug resistance. Reports on impaired clinical response of uncomplicated falciparum malaria due to use of poor-quality artemether and decreased sensitivity of the parasite on artesunate were recently published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Already, there are sporadic reports of resistance against ACT in some malarious regions, creating a concern on the longevity of the currently available and effective anti-malarial drugs in the SSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>This paper reports a comparative bioavailability findings between the most available generic tablet formulation containing artemether and lumefantrine (Artefan&#x000ae;) <italic>(</italic>Ajanta Pharma Ltd-India) and Coartem&#x000ae; (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) as innovator&#x02019;s product.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title><sec><title>Determination of the most prevalent generic</title><p>The study was conducted between February and April 2012. It was preceded by a cross-sectional survey to reveal the most abundant and prescribed generic formulation containing a fixed combination of Alu tablet on the Dar es Salaam market. Among others, Artefan&#x000ae; was found to be abundant and thereafter was subjected to bioequivalence study using Coartem&#x000ae; as comparator.</p></sec><sec><title>Sampling of tablets</title><p>Two hundred and twenty four tablets of Artefan&#x000ae; (test formulation), a fixed-dose combination tablets consisting of 20&#x000a0;mg of artemether and 120&#x000a0;mg of lumefantrine (B.No./No.LOT.P0511H, TAN 09.085.PO1BAJA, expiration date July 2013) were purchased from one wholesale pharmacy in Dar es Salaam.

The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS) and Ifakara Health Institute (IHI) institutional review boards. The study was conducted according to Good Clinical Practice. To ensure confidentiality, identification numbers (ID codes) were used instead of volunteers&#x02019; names.</p></sec><sec><title>Study area</title><p>Recruitment and enrollment of the study volunteers took place at Bagamoyo Clinical Trial Unit in Bagamoyo district. BCTU is part of IHI&#x02019;s Bagamoyo Research and Training Centre (BRTC). The unit is designed to conduct early phase studies where volunteers can be retained for the entire period of study. The facility has dedicated areas for essential study procedures including volunteer screening, blood sample collection, investigational product preparation, ICU for management of serious adverse events and research wards.

Permission to conduct sensitization meetings was sought from College administration and thereafter advertisement for the meetings was posted on the college notice board. Interested participants were asked to register their names and invited to attend sensitization meeting where detailed explanation and clarification about the study was given followed by screening of potential subjects in which the potentially eligible participants were identified.</p></sec><sec><title>Screening for eligible participants</title><p>Screening was performed to all potential subjects at baseline and based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria to get eligible participants who were then enrolled for the entire study. Baseline screening included taking medical history, performing physical, medical examination and blood laboratory tests. Physical and medical examinations included checking vital signs and performing Electrocardiogram (ECG). Laboratory tests included parasitology (blood slide for malaria parasites), haematology (FBC) and biochemistry (urea, creatinine, total bilirubin, ALT, AST, ALP and albumin).</p></sec><sec><title>Enrollment</title><p>Eligible subjects were those who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. Out of 31 subjects screened, 18 were enrolled into the study and were randomized into treatment sequence. The participants were advised to abstain from eating grape fruits and drinking grape fruit juice during the entire period of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and study procedures</title><p>The eighteen volunteers were randomly assigned to either of the treatment sequence: test period 1, reference period 2; or reference period 1, test period 2. At drug administration, the pharmacist opened a sealed envelope with the corresponding treatment number, which contained the drug allocation for the treatment period, and appropriate drug was administered. The investigators were blinded on the drug, which each volunteer took. The randomization code was kept in the BCTU Data Unit and was decoded (broken) after all the PK analysis had been completed.</p></sec><sec><title>Drug administration, blood sampling and subject follow-up</title><p>Each enrolled volunteer received a single adult dose (80/480&#x000a0;mg artemether and lumefantrine respectively) of either Coartem&#x000ae; or Artefan&#x000ae; with a glass of water (200&#x000a0;ml) under supervision of the pharmacist followed by standardized fatty meal. After a 42-day washout period, the volunteers took the alternative drug. On the day of enrolment participants were admitted and retained at the BCTU for three days (72&#x000a0;hours).</p><p>Subjects were discharged and returned to BCTU at 168&#x000a0;hours for one blood sample collection and allowed back to college. On each period all subjects underwent clinical evaluations to monitor for adverse drug reactions and assess medication tolerability . This was done at 0.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 168&#x000a0;hours post dosing.</p></sec><sec><title>Blood sampling and sample processing</title><p>A total of 18 eligible volunteers were enrolled to participate in this study. FDA allows a minimum number of 12 volunteers for bioequivalence study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The enrolled volunteers arrived at the BCTU for stay after an overnight fasting. Written informed consent was obtained from each volunteer before participation.</p><p>Subjects had a heparinized saline lock placed in an arm to obtain serial venous blood samples for plasma drug concentrations for the first 24&#x000a0;hours. Each subject had a predose blood sample drawn (time&#x02009;=&#x02009;0) and took an observed dose of the test or reference drug. Subsequent blood samples were drawn at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 168&#x000a0;hours after the dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. After a 42-day washout period, the subjects took an observed dose of the alternative Alu formulation. Study procedures and blood sampling were repeated as described previously. Each subject had 22 blood samples (3&#x000a0;ml each) drawn over the course of the study for determination of lumefantrine plasma concentrations. The total amount of blood sample collected in the whole study period from each volunteer was 66&#x000a0;ml.</p><p>The blood samples were collected in heparinized vacutainers. Each vacutainer was appropriately labeled with Brady number, subject&#x02019;s identification number (ID), sampling time, sampling hour and date. Blood samples were kept in a cool box and transported within 45&#x000a0;minutes to a BRTC laboratory for centrifugation. The samples were centrifuged at 1800&#x000a0;g at 4&#x000b0;C to obtain plasma samples which were transferred into similarly labeled cryovials. The plasma samples were kept in IHI&#x02019;s BRTC laboratory at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until transfer to MUHAS-Bioanalytical Laboratory in Dar es Salaam. The samples were carried in a cool box packed with liquid nitrogen.

The mean AUC values of lumefantrine for both Artefan&#x000ae; and Coartem&#x000ae; were within range of 108,000 and 243,000&#x000a0;ng.h/ml obtained by Novartis (see Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). This means that both Artefan&#x000ae; and Coartem&#x000ae; had comparable bioavailability and would equally achieve comparable therapeutic plasma lumefantrine concentrations.</p><p>Lumefantrine day 7 plasma concentration is predictive of the treatment outcome in malaria patients who complete the six doses taken for three consecutive days. Patients with lumefantrine levels below 175&#x000a0;ng/ml on day 7 are more likely to experience recrudescence by day 21 or 28 allowing prediction of treatment failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In this study, the patients took a single Alu dose (4 tablets) and the mean day 7 lumefantrine levels were 163.00 &#x000b1;148.01 and 171.82 &#x000b1;116.59 for Artefan&#x000ae; and Coartem&#x000ae; respectively (p-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.98). Despite taking a single dose versus six doses recommended for non-severe malaria treatment, the mean day 7 plasma concentration values were very close to the cut off point and had no statistical significant difference from the latter (175&#x000a0;ng/ml) indicating that both Artefan&#x000ae; and Coartem&#x000ae; are likely to produce adequate drug plasma concentrations to exert antiplasmodial action. The mean and median day 7 lumefantrine plasma concentrations obtained from Artefan&#x000ae; and Coartem&#x000ae;, respectively, were comparable. However, due to observed high inter-individual variability in lumefantrine plasma concentrations, there is possibility of occurrence of treatment failure or drug toxicity in some individuals treated with either Coartem&#x000ae; or Artefan&#x000ae;.</p><p>In assessing bioequivalence between Artefan&#x000ae; and Coartem&#x000ae; it was observed that the geometric mean ratios for C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>0-t</sub> and AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub> were within the acceptable FDA criteria for bioequivalence of 0.8 &#x02013; 1.25 (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). The overall lumefantrine pharmacokinetic profiles (pharmacokinetic parameters) for both Artefan&#x000ae; and Coartem&#x000ae; in the healthy Tanzanian volunteers by visual inspection appear to be comparable (see Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>However, the 90% confidence intervals for lumefantrine (18 subjects) C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>0-168</sub>, and AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub> mean ratios were not within 0.80 to 1.25 (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> is a Forest plot indicating 90% confidence interval limits for the ratios of Cmax, AUC 0&#x02013;168 and AUC 0-&#x0221e; obtained by the study and indicates the required limits in line with FDA requirements for BE studies. As shown in the plot, the two tablet formulations could not meet the FDA criterion for bioequivalence. Failure to comply with the FDA 90% confidence intervals may be due to high variability of lumefantrine plasma concentrations observed among individual subjects.</p><p>High inter-individual variability for lumefantrine plasma concentration observed in this study could also be due to difference in the capacity of individuals to handle the drug with respect to cytochrome 3A4 (CYP3A4) as well as inconsistency in the extent of drug presentation in the systemic circulation through the gastro-intestinal tract. CYP3A4/5 is expressed in the human small intestine and liver and contributes to the first pass effect of lumefantrine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Lumefantrine is a substrate of CYP3A4/5 which has been shown to be polymorphic. Therefore, drugs undergoing first pass effect by this isoform are expected to have highly variable pharmacokinetics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although the ratios of AUCs and C<sub>max</sub> were within the acceptable FDA range, bioequivalence between Artefan&#x000ae; and Coartem&#x000ae; tablet formulations could not be demonstrated due to failure to comply with the FDA 90% confidence interval criteria. It is the failure to comply with 90% confidence interval stipulated by FDA guidelines, which made the two tablet formulations to be bioinequivalent. However, based on the observed total drug exposure (AUCs and day 7 plasma lumefantrine concentrations), Artefan&#x000ae; is likely to produce a similar therapeutic response as Coartem&#x000ae;.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>We declare no competing interest of any kind in this work.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contribution</title><p>OMSM, SP and NE conceived the study, and participated in its design, coordination, data analysis and writing of the manuscript.
