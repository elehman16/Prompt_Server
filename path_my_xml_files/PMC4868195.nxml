reduce the curvature of idiopathic scoliosis, which commonly occurs in elementary school
children. [Subjects] The subjects of this study were 5 healthy elementary students who
listened to an explanation of the study methods and purpose of the study and agreed to
participate in the experiment. [Methods] The Cobb angle was measured by taking an X-ray
(FCT-1, Dongmun, Goyangsi, Republic of Korea) taken from the rear, using X-ray film. The
method of intervention this study used was application of chiropractic techniques. Spinal
correction was carried out for 30 minutes per session, which included soft tissue massage,
3 times a week for 8 weeks. [Results] It was established that the Cobb angle was
noticeably decreased after 4 weeks of the intervention. Post Hoc analysis revealed that
the Cobb angle noticeably decreased after 4 weeks compared with the Cobb angle before the
chiropractic techniques were applied. However, no significant difference in Cobb angle was
evident after the fourth week. [Conclusion] This study demonstrated that chiropractic
techniques can effectively reduce the Cobb angle within as little as 4 weeks. So, we can
confirm that the chiropractic techniques were effective for reducing the curvature of
idiopathic scoliosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Scoliosis</kwd><kwd>Cobb angle</kwd><kwd>Chiropractic technique</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Most students today have many posture-related health problems due to academic stress and
habits that cause inadequate posture, i.e, using a computer for long hours, incongruent
height of a desk and a chair, heavy backpacks, and lack of exercise<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, even when there is no clear cause, it is
easy for spinal deformity to occur in adolescence, and once spinal deformity begins, the
spinal curvature consistently becomes more severe. Therefore, it may develop into scoliosis.
The word scoliosis was first used by Galen (AD 131-201), and it referred to one or more
vertebrae slanting sideways and therefore exhibiting lateral declination and rotation<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Currently, a Cobb angle above 10&#x000b0; is
defined as scoliosis<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, and in children,
idiopathic scoliosis of unknown cause occurs quite commonly<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to domestic and foreign reports, researchers have come up
with different results, but it is commonly known that the prevalence rate of scoliosis is
about 0.3% to 21.0%<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Idiopathic scoliosis
occurs slowly and gradually, hence it is hard for the parents and children themselves to
discover it until it fully develops into scoliosis<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Complications that arise secondarily are malfunction<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, fatigue and pain<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, neurological complications, problems with appearance<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, psychological problems<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, and shortening of life expectancy<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Because of the many of health problems that appear as
scoliosis advances, awareness of the need for early diagnosis of scoliosis and early
conservative treatment is increasing. In particular, one report demonstrated that early
discovery and treatment, and sometimes surgical intervention, are effective in managing
scoliosis<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In 1981, it was discovered
in Sweden that early examination and early treatment can reduce the progress of scoliosis
from 40% to 63%<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In 15 of the 50 states
of the United States, screening for scoliosis in school is required by law. The American
Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons recommends that female students should be screened twice
between the ages of 11 and 13 and that male students should be screened once between the
ages of 13 and 14<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Both conservative and surgical treatments for scoliosis are available. Conservative
treatments include treatment using physical parameters, exercise treatment, physiotherapy
including degree revisal, and a support device that is used to restrain scoliosis from
progressing further<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many studies have
been undertaken on exercises that can control the imbalance of muscles around the spine.
Studies on the effect of exercise treatments, such as the effect of early exercise treatment
on idiopathic scoliosis occurring in elementary school students<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, the effect of core muscle relaxation technique on the
Cobb angle in scoliosis<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, the effect of
Swiss ball exercise on respiratory function and trunk regulation ability of scoliosis
patients<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the effect of height
exercise, Schroth exercise, and other strengthening exercises on scoliosis<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, have been undertaken. However, studies on
the effect of spine correction, which falls in the category of conservative treatments, are
lacking. A few studies, such studies of the effect of body correction on structural
scoliosis<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, the effect of body
correction on the Cobb angle of high school female students with scoliosis<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, the effect of scoliosis angle on center
of gravity sway<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the good way to
assess scoliosis<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>, have been performed. However, these studies are few in number in
comparison with the studies on the effects of exercise treatment on scoliosis.</p><p>Therefore, this study examined whether chiropractic techniques applied to elementary school
children who were confirmed to be suffering from idiopathic scoliosis would reduce the
spinal curvature at an early stage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>In order to select participants for this study, a forward bending test was carried out on

study participants was 11.8, the average height as 144.4&#x02005;cm, and the average weight was
40.4&#x02005;kg. The average Cobb angle before the intervention was 11.2&#x000b0; (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The Cobb angle was measured by taking an X-ray (FCT-1, Dongmun, Goyangsi, Republic of
Korea) from the rear, using X-ray film. Lines were drawn on the film connecting the upper
spine at the top of the concave part of the curvature with the lower spine at the bottom of
the curvature, and then a perpendicular line was drawn from each line, and the angle where
the perpendicular lines intersected was the Cobb angle<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The method of intervention this study used was application of chiropractic techniques. In
application of chiropractic techniques, the part of the spine that does not maintain correct
alignment is identified, and the spine is adjusted with force to achieve proper alignment.
Sudden, momentary pressure is administered against the spinal area, and if muscles around
the spine are tense, there is a possibility of muscle damage, so it is necessary to relax
soft tissues around the vertebrae before applying chiropractic techniques. For this reason,
a soft tissue massage was given to the subjects prior to chiropractic treatment. The
chiropractic techniques used in this study were correction techniques for the iliac and
mammillary processes of lumbar vertebrae, which are pelvic and lumbar correction methods.
Thoracic vertebral correction techniques for the transverse processes of thoracic vertebrae
were performed utilizing the therapist&#x02019;s hands. Furthermore, the correction techniques for
the transverse processes of the atlas and articular processes of the cervical vertebrae,
which are cervical vertebra correction methods, were used<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Spine correction was carried out for 30 minutes per session
including soft tissue massage, 3 times a week for 8 weeks<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Normality of the data for 5 study participants was tested and verified by Shapiro-Wilk
test. In order to quantify the decrease in Cobb angle after 4 weeks and again after 8 weeks
compared with the Cobb angle before the intervention, repeated measures ANOVA tests were
performed. The statistical program used for this study was IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows
(ver. 21.0), and the significance level used was set as &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>The changes in Cobb angle in each subject (Unit: degrees)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Subjects*</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Before intervention</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">After 4 weeks</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">After 8 weeks</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (M)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (M)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (M)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (M)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (F)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean&#x000b1;SD</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.2&#x000b1;1.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.4&#x000b1;3.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.0&#x000b1;2.2</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>F: female; M: male *Adapted from Byeon, 2008</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap> shows the results regarding the changes in Cobb angle in each participant.

to changes in the level of tension in muscles around the spine. If this kind of change is
allowed to continue, the muscles on either side of the spine do not develop in balance, and
this causes muscles on one side to shorten abnormally and muscles on the other side to
stretch abnormally, hence causing the spine to displace in one direction, causing curvature
of the spine. Thus, the main body of the spine getting displaced in one direction rotates,
exacerbating the curvature further to the point that it becomes visible. Scoliosis results
in spine displacement sagittally, spine centrifugal distortion horizontally, and an abnormal
curvature. All of these things cause pain, restrictions to spinal movement, and
degeneration. Regarding this matter, McMorland and Suter<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup> stated that abnormal stresses arise around the affected joints when
vertebrae are displaced and that the pain and restrictions to range of motion
consequentially occur. Park<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that as a result of identifying the relationship between spinal instability, vertebral
displacement and vertebral degeneration, spinal instability, vertebral displacement, and
increased arthritis were demonstrated to be associated with scoliosis of the spine. Since
scoliosis causes pain and motion restriction, thereby deteriorating the quality of life, it
is important to discover and treat it at an early stage.</p><p>The general principles of scoliosis treatment include correction of transformed spine
curvature, and strengthening of related soft tissues. Hence in order to treat scoliosis, it
is necessary to adjust spinal rotation, push the spine towards the opposite direction of its
abnormal bending to align the vertebrae correctly, and balance the muscles around the spine
that have developed asymmetrically.</p><p>Lee<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> stated that exercises for
strengthening muscles around the spine were effective in prevention and treatment of
scoliosis. Choi<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that as a
result of implementing exercises to cure elementary school students with idiopathic
scoliosis in the early stages, the Cobb angle decreased. Cho and Jang<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that as a result of applying an exercise program
to strengthen the trunk and extremity muscles in adolescents, the Cobb angle improved along
with improvement of muscular strength and muscular endurance. These kinds of results imply
that if the balance of muscles on either side of the spine is fixed through muscle
strengthening exercises, scoliosis could be improved.</p><p>However, when the level of scoliosis is moderate or severe, the benefits of exercise<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup> are limited. For that reason, interest in
degree correction methods as methods of scoliosis treatment to correct vertebral alignment
is increasing. Park et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that as a result of implementing manipulative therapy combining the Gonstead technique and
Cox technique in female high school students with scoliosis, the Cobb angle improved. Romano
and Negrini<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that as a result
of systematic review, chiropractic techniques, and manipulation, positive effects on
reduction of the angle in scoliosis were achieved. In application of chiropractic
techniques, a specific area of the vertebrae and joint is identified, and a rapid,
low-amplitude stimulus is applied to correct the joint by applying force to it so that the
joint moves into the physiological range and past the elastic range, which is the normal
motion range of the joint<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore,
chiropractic techniques are known to correct a twisted spine, restore muscle imbalance, help
restore functions of spinal nerves<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
stimulate the Golgi tendon organ located around tendons to relax muscle and expand motion
range<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, even though
chiropractic techniques have a positive effect on spine correction, studies on the effect of
chiropractic techniques in the correction of scoliosis in growing adolescents are lacking.
Hence, this study aimed to identify the effect of chiropractic techniques on scoliosis in
elementary school students. The results showed that the spinal curvature in the subjects was
reduced significantly in 4 weeks, although there was no significant difference between 4
weeks and 8 weeks. These results imply that chiropractic techniques performed on children
with idiopathic scoliosis can achieve a near-normal spinal alignment within 4 weeks. On the
other hand, since the number of study participants was small, this study is too limited in
scope to be able to predict results in a larger population. Therefore, a study that applies
chiropractic techniques to a larger number of participants and observes and records the
effects should be performed. Nevertheless, the results of this study imply that in clinical
practice, a direct correction to the spine is necessary for treating scoliosis. Hence spinal
correction should be included as a part of the program for treatment of scoliosis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The data, subjects, and methods in this study were based on the master&#x02019;s thesis of
