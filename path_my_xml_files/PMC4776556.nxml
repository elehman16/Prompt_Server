While the control group received routine care, the experiment group benefitted from logotherapy-based education program (six 90-min sessions, twice a week).

The post-test mean score change [Standard Error (SE)] in the intervention group was 24.95 (3) and in the control group was 9.27 (0.82). There were significant differences between the two groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).

About half of the patients have been reported to suffer from depression and some other psychological problems after CABG, which is attributed to impaired function, an increase in the level and duration of pain, more re-hospitalizations, and increased morbidity and mortality, which consequently lead to a reduction in their QOL.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] It seems that psychosocial interventions due to their effects on pain, severe anxiety, anger and, depression could improve the patients&#x02019; QOL;[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] however, there is no strong evidence supporting that psychosocial interventions could improve the CABG patients&#x02019; QOL, because they often suffer from functional impairments.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Existential approaches as one of the psychosocial interventions have been adopted to improve function in patients. Logotherapy is one of these approaches through which the patients are helped to find a new meaning for their miserable life events to have more adaptation with the disease.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Shoaa-Kazemi and Saadati reported that education based on logotherapy reduced hopelessness in women with breast cancer.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In another study, group logotherapy led to increase in life expectancy and general health in adolescent girls suffering from thalassemia.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Positive effects of this approach have been reported on depression and hopelessness in the disabled with a spinal cord injury.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Moreover, some other researchers tried to investigate the effect of interventions with the approach of logotherapy, specifically on increase in QOL. For instance, Kang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and Kang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] reported that logotherapy improved QOL in adolescents with cancer, and Mosalanejad and Koolee[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] also supported the benefits of this approach in distressed infertile women.</p><p>In spite of various studies supporting the beneficial effects of logotherapy-based interventions on improvement of patients&#x02019; functions and finally their QOL, there was not any convincing evidence on the effects of this intervention on the QOL of cardiac patients after CABG.</p><p>As such an approach could be applied and potentially accepted by the nurses to improve the patients&#x02019; QOL,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] this study was conducted to evaluate the effect of education, based on the main concepts of logotherapy approach, on the CABG patients&#x02019; QOL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This is a quasi-experimental study with a two-group and pre-test&#x02013;post-test intervention conducted on patients undergoing CABG in the surgery ward of Chemran University Hospital in Isfahan in 2013. Inclusion criteria were age over 35 years, ability to attend the project, passing recovery period 1&#x02013;2 months after CABG, no previous education of logotherapy, and subjects&#x02019; personal interest to attend the study.</p><p>Based on the medical evidences and files, it was ensured that the patients had no diagnosed mental diseases, mental ret ardation, blindness, deafness, and Alzheimer at the time of their participation in the study. The subjects who lost interest to participate in the study or were absent for two sequential sessions of educational intervention due to any reason were excluded. Sample size was primarily calculated as 54 subjects based on consultation with statisticians and with regard to previous studies. Considering subjects dropping out of the study, sample size was finally calculated as 75 subjects, who were conveniently recruited from Oct to Jan 2013 from among the patients who had undergone CABG surgery and were referred to the surgery ward of Chamran University Hospital in Isfahan. The subjects were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. A written consent was obtained from all subjects before they attended the study. The subjects were assured about confidentiality of their data. All subjects were free to leave the study at any time they liked. The content of the program comprised an educational booklet based on Frankl's logotherapy theory, collected and designed by the research team from the relevant literature [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Content validity of the booklet was approved by 10 expert people (6 psychologists and 4 psychiatric nurses). The training sessions were mainly conducted by the principal researcher (M. M.) who was an experienced nurse. However, he was continuously supervised by his advisors and sometimes by some other experienced psychologists who were not members of the research team.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Content of logotherapy approach education program (duration of each session was 90 min)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJNMR-21-14-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Both groups received routine CABG post surgery education. In the intervention group, the subjects received an educational program based on the main concepts of logotherapy. The educational sessions were held in the form of six 90-min sessions twice a week based on the studies of Kang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and Shoaa-Kazemi and Saadati.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Subjects in the intervention group were divided into four 10-member sub-groups. The educational program was carried out with quite similar conditions such as the educator, environment, temperature, light, etc., in the study sub-groups. Lecture, question and answer, and group discussion were adopted to present the educational materials. At the end of the educational sessions, a brief educational booklet, related to each session, was given to the subjects. The control group subjects received CABG postoperative routine education. After completing the research period, they received the educational booklet and related electronic file.</p><p>Data collection tool was a two-section questionnaire. The first section contained subjects&#x02019; demographic and clinical characteristics that were collected by questioning the patients and their accompanying persons as well as referring to their medical records. In the second section, SF-36 QOL questionnaire was used. It has eight dimensions of general health (6 items), physical functioning (10 items), role physical (4 items), role emotional (3 items), bodily pain (2 items), social functioning (2 items), vitality (3 items), and mental health (6 items).</p><p>The scores range from 0 to 100 in each domain, so that score 0 shows the worst and score 100 shows the best condition in each domain.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] This questionnaire was filled through questioning. Validity and reliability of SF-36 have been investigated in various groups of patients. Failde and Ramos accredited this questionnaire in coronary artery disease patients and reported its high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.72&#x02013;0.94).[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Reliability of Persian version of this questionnaire, measured in the study of Dehdari <italic>et al</italic>. through precede-proceed method with a 2-week interval, was reported to be 0.76 (<italic>r</italic> = 0.76).[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The questionnaire was filled in both groups at the beginning and 50 days after intervention in similar conditions.

The results showed that mean score changes of six QOL dimensions and overall QOL significantly increased in the intervention group. Meanwhile, no significant difference was observed in the two dimensions of physical function and role play limitation due to physical reasons between the intervention and control groups (although mean scores changes were more in the intervention group).</p><p>Although the present study shares some specific results in this topic, some parts of the results are in line with other similar studies, all of which are discussed. In support of the usefulness of logotherapy-based interventions in vitality and general health, Gholami <italic>et al</italic>. investigated the effect of logotherapy among the thalassemic girls and reported that it was effective on subjects&#x02019; life expectancy and general health.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Although their study was not carried out on CABG patients, their results have strengthened the proposition of logotherapy-based interventions to be as useful to improve some parts of QOL. In another study that was conducted by Ho <italic>et al</italic>. (2010) in Hong Kong, the results supported the positive association between adolescents&#x02019; meaning in life and their optimism and well-being.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] This result may support the usefulness of improving peoples&#x02019; meaning in life, which is the main theme of logotherapy, in increasing the sense of well-being, which is known as an indicator of mental health. Some other studies have supported the effect of logotherapy on patients&#x02019; mental health. For instance, Hosseinzadeh-Khezri <italic>et al</italic>. reported that group logotherapy interventions could effectively influence mental and psychological dimensions in patients with life-threatening diseases, such as cancer patients.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Nevertheless, future researches are necessary to investigate the effect of logotherapy-based intervention on the CABG patients&#x02019; mental health.</p><p>Another finding of the present study, the usefulness of the logotherapy-based intervention on the patients&#x02019; physical functioning, is not supported by reports in literature. Likewise, de Leon <italic>et al</italic>. investigated the effect of a psychosocial intervention based on cognitive therapy, compared to common care on the QOL of 2481 patients after myocardial infarction (MI). Six months after intervention, it was found that those interventions had a positive effect on the mental health dimension of QOL while they had little effect on the physical dimensions of QOL, and overall QOL had improved a little.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Moreover, Fakhar <italic>et al</italic>. also reported that group counseling with a logo-therapeutic approach led to an increase in mental health and social action of older adult women, but had no notable effect on their physical complaints.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Likewise, La Pier[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] reported that the physical components of QOL showed no notable improvement 6 months after CABG, compared to the mental components. It seems that psychosocial interventions tend to improve psychosocial functioning and psychosocial dimensions of QOL, rather than its physical dimension. A potential justification is that physical functioning dimension of QOL is associated with the level of the patients&#x02019; physical activities and surgery-related complications, and therefore, the process of recovery is longer in this dimension. La Pier reported that an improvement in physical dimension of the QOL is a gradual process and takes about 1 year time.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Nevertheless, further studies are needed investigating the usefulness of psychosocial interventions in the CABG patients&#x02019; physical functioning.</p><p>The present study also supported the improvement of social functioning following psychosocial logotherapy-based intervention. It seems to be a desirable finding, although there are some contradicting evidences. For example, in Ghanbari and Goudarzi's study, the social dimension of general health did not improve in the distressed women by group counseling with a logotherapy approach.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Such disparities of evidences may be attributed to different study samples, study contexts, and particular effects of CABG on the patients&#x02019; QOL. Therefore, there is a need of particular and tailored interventions to meet these patients&#x02019; health needs.</p><p>This study is faced with some limitations, such as small sample size, which could limit the generalization of the findings. Future studies with large sample sizes and in a variety of contexts are need to ensure the optimal effects of logotherapy-based education intervention on all dimensions of the CABG patients&#x02019; QOL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>The present study showed that educational interventions, based on the main concepts of logotherapy, led to an improvement in patients&#x02019; QOL after CABG. It is recommended to combine such education with routine education of the patients undergoing CABG. Future researches are also suggested to ensure the usefulness of psychosocial interventions like logotherapy-based education on the physical dimension of the CABG patients&#x02019; QOL.</p></sec><sec><title>A<sc>CKNOWLEDGMENT</sc></title><p>This article was derived from a master thesis of Mostafa Mahdizadeh, with project number 392400, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.
