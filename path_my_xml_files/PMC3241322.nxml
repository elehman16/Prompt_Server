Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery for treatment of obesity leads to long-term diabetes remission in &#x0223c;80% of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), whereas very limited effects are observed with lifestyle intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Improvements in diabetes are reported to occur immediately after RYGB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), with &#x0223c;30% of patients being discharged from the hospital with discontinuation of all diabetes medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>Impaired insulin sensitivity (insulin resistance) at the liver and in the periphery (primarily skeletal muscle) is an underlying mechanism of and precursor to diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Several studies have described a long-term improvement in peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity 6 months to 1 year after RYGB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), which is considered to occur secondary to weight loss. The mechanisms of the immediate improvement in diabetes after RYGB, before substantial weight loss, are not well delineated. Improvements in insulin sensitivity are reported early after RYGB, by hyperglycemic clamp at 1 and 4 weeks postoperatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) or by intravenous glucose tolerance tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) during the first week postoperatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). These approaches to measure insulin sensitivity, however, cannot distinguish between peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity. The hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp method in conjunction with isotopically labeled tracer infusion allows measurement of peripheral (primarily skeletal muscle) insulin sensitivity as well as hepatic glucose production (HGP) and hepatic insulin sensitivity. Two studies have used this technique to assess insulin sensitivity early after RYGB, and interestingly, did not find a significant improvement in peripheral insulin sensitivity 2 to 4 weeks after RYGB; however, hepatic insulin sensitivity was not assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Recently, Camastra et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) reported that peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity did not change at 2 weeks after RYGB in patients with and without diabetes.</p><p>Increased visceral fat is considered an important risk factor for diabetes and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). We recently reported, however, that surgical removal of the greater omentum (omentectomy) in conjunction with RYGB did not augment the improvement in insulin sensitivity long-term after RYGB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Here we report the acute effects of RYGB with or without omentectomy on hepatic and skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity. This was assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with tracer infusion at 1 month after RYGB. We also tested the hypothesis that an early remission of diabetes after RYGB is associated with improved hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity.</p><sec id="s5"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s6"><title>Study protocol and participants</title><p>The study was approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional Review Board, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. From March 2005 through November 2009, we recruited patients aged between 18 and 60 years from the Vanderbilt Center for Surgical Weight Loss (Nashville, TN) after approval for RYGB. Study recruitment was concluded when the analysis of primary outcome measures revealed no long-term effect of omentectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).

The study coordinator held the randomization code, and all participants and study personnel were blinded to omentectomy status. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps with glucose tracer infusions were completed preoperatively and at 33 &#x000b1; 7 days (range 21&#x02013;49) postoperatively in 40 subjects (5 men and 35 women) aged 42 &#x000b1; 9 years.</p><p>At 1 month after RYGB, patients were counseled by a bariatric surgery dietitian to consume a diet of pureed or soft foods with a caloric intake of &#x0223c;600 to 800 kcal/day. Subjects with type 2 diabetes discontinued oral diabetes medications and long-acting insulin 5 days before a study visit, and therapy with short-acting insulin was initiated to temporarily control hyperglycemia, if needed.</p><p>The primary outcome measure was the effect of omentectomy on hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity. We further analyzed the data for differential improvements in insulin sensitivity in patients with and without preoperative diabetes and the relationship between early postoperative remission of diabetes and improvements in hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Study procedures</title><p>Participants were admitted to the Vanderbilt Clinical Research Center the evening before the study, given a standard meal, and fasted overnight. The next morning, a catheter was inserted into a forearm vein to infuse high-performance liquid chromatography purified [3-<sup>3</sup>H]glucose (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA), potassium, dextrose, and insulin. A second catheter was inserted into a contralateral superficial forearm or hand vein, which was heated, to obtain arterialized blood samples. A primed (33 &#x003bc;Ci), continuous (0.14 &#x003bc;Ci/min) infusion of [3-<sup>3</sup>H]glucose was maintained for 2.5 h.

Euglycemia (90&#x02013;100 mg/dL) was maintained by a variable infusion of 20% dextrose.

No significant postoperative complications occurred. The study coordinator notified the surgeon of the randomization assignment at the beginning of the procedure, and 756 &#x000b1; 334 g (range 400&#x02013;1,675) of greater omentum was surgically removed.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Sample collection and analysis</title><p>Glucose was measured using the glucose oxidase method (Beckman Glucose Analyzer; Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA).

Plasma concentrations of insulin were determined by radioimmunoassay (Millipore, Billerica, MA).

To determine this, we measured hepatic and muscle insulin sensitivity with a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Our major finding was that at 1 month after RYGB, hepatic insulin sensitivity improved whereas skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity did not. In addition, hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity was not influenced by surgical removal of the omentum, as postoperative values were similar in the groups who did and did not undergo omentectomy. Lima et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) reported that omentectomy did not affect peripheral insulin sensitivity at 1 month after RYGB, but they did not directly assess hepatic insulin sensitivity. We have previously reported that omentectomy does not influence metabolic outcomes of RYGB after long-term follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>The rapid and sustained improvement in diabetes after RYGB has contributed to the American Diabetes Association recommending bariatric surgery as a therapeutic option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). We report a 59% remission rate of diabetes at 1 month after RYGB. We found that a preoperative diagnosis of diabetes neither influenced preoperative nor early post-RYGB glucose disposal, supporting that peripheral tissues (predominately skeletal muscle) do not contribute to the early metabolic improvements after surgery in patients with or without diabetes. Conversely, patients with a preoperative diagnosis of diabetes had higher HGP before surgery that improved after surgery, whereas those without diabetes had limited improvements; therefore, at least in patients with diabetes, early metabolic improvements appear to be predominantly due to improved hepatic insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, the subjects who achieved diabetes remission at 1 month after RYGB had postoperative hepatic insulin sensitivity similar to subjects without diabetes, whereas those who did not have remission continued to have elevated HGP. These data support that hepatic insulin sensitivity has a role in early remission of diabetes. A limitation in these analyses is the absence of information regarding the duration of diabetes in these subjects and its potential impact on short-term remission of diabetes after RYGB. The amount of weight loss has been shown to predict diabetes remission from 3 to 24 months postoperatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), but we did not find an effect of weight loss on acute diabetes remission. Pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell function also exhibits improvement early after RYGB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), and early improvements in diabetes may also reflect changes in &#x003b2;-cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>We have recently reported that the improvements in insulin sensitivity in the first week after RYGB are primarily due to caloric restriction. HOMA improved similarly in the first week after RYGB compared with equally obese subjects who underwent a matched diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). HOMA is based on fasting levels of glucose and insulin, and although it does correlate well with whole-body glucose disposal during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, it is considered a better representation of HGP and insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Caloric restriction at a level similar to the first week after RYGB has been shown to decrease HGP without altered whole-body glucose disposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), and this reduction in HGP is due to reduced glycogenolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Therefore, the improvements in insulin resistance in the first week after RYGB that we (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) have reported may reflect decreased HGP resulting from caloric restriction. Only one other study measured acute hepatic responses to RYGB (2 weeks) and found no change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>We determined muscle insulin sensitivity with high insulin levels that completely suppress HGP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), allowing us to show that, overall, skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity does not improve at 1 month after surgery; greater weight loss is likely needed for this effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). We achieved similar insulin levels during insulin infusions before RYGB and at 1 month after RYGB, supporting that a lack of change in glucose disposal is not due to differences in steady-state insulin concentrations from baseline to post-RYGB. This is consistent with other reports that glucose disposal is not altered early after RYGB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>); these studies also used hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps but at a lower insulin dose (40 mU&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) than our study. Interestingly, Kashyap et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) describes an increase in the M/I value during a hyperglycemic clamp at 1 month after RYGB. Although this method is generally used to assess insulin secretion and &#x003b2;-cell function, insulin sensitivity measures have been shown to correlate with the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Caloric restriction has been shown to have an inconsistent effect on glucose disposal in obese subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Perhaps greater weight loss is necessary to achieve a consistent improvement in peripheral insulin sensitivity after RYGB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>We found that the acute effect of RYGB on peripheral insulin sensitivity was variable among individuals, similar to the observation by Lima et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Because of our large sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 40), we were also able to notice that the preoperative glucose disposal value predicts the direction of change after surgery. Subjects who were the most insulin resistant before surgery improved postoperatively, whereas those with higher preoperative insulin sensitivity worsened after surgery. This relationship was strong in participants with and without diabetes and cannot be attributed to incomplete medication withdrawal in those with diabetes. Furthermore, the degree of weight loss was not associated with postoperative changes in peripheral insulin sensitivity. Although major improvements in peripheral insulin sensitivity are likely related to weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), whole-body glucose disposal has been reported to decrease in lean subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) and to be unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) or increased in obese subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) with short-term caloric restriction. Thus, the most insulin-sensitive obese individuals in our cohort may be responding to RYGB similarly to calorically restricted lean individuals by decreasing glucose disposal. Although our data support that the response of peripheral insulin sensitivity to caloric restriction/moderate weight loss is dependent on baseline insulin sensitivity, the verification and relevance of these findings requires further study in an independent cohort.</p><p>Our cumulative work supports caloric restriction as a mediator of early metabolic improvements after RYGB, and reducing visceral fat by omentectomy is not beneficial acutely or long-term after RYGB. At this early time after surgery, skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity did not improve overall or influence remission of diabetes. Importantly, we report that at 1 month after RYGB, glucose production decreased and hepatic insulin sensitivity improved, which emerges as a potential mechanism for early diabetes remission.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
