The prevalence rates for this age are 2% for anorexia nervosa, 1% for bulimia nervosa and 2% for binge eating disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Substantially more adolescents are affected by eating disorder symptomatology, i.e., dieting, weight loss behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] or restrained eating and weight concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Once full-blown eating disorders emerge, the initiation of a recommended treatment is often delated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and particularly anorexia nervosa exhibits a high risk of chronicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Against this background, an implementation of eating disorder prevention programs during adolescence is particularly important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Different considerations plead for an implementation of eating disorder prevention programs in the classroom setting during adolescence. From a theoretical point of view, female and male adolescents make up an important part of the social environment for each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Including complete classes as the most relevant peer group provides the opportunity to increase awareness of the adverse effect of peer pressure on eating disorder development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Peers influence the extent of pressure to suit Western beauty ideals, individual appearance related attitudes and body dissatisfaction which are all risk factors for eating disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Additionally, an overlap of further eating disorder risk factors such as a low self-esteem and negative affects like depression and anxiety has to be expected in female and male adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. From a practical point of view, it is easier for schools to deliver prevention programs to whole classes as most schools are co-educational.</p><p id="Par15">Prevention programs delivered to whole classes follow a universal prevention approach as female and male adolescents participate without prior screening and regardless of risk status. In the field of eating disorders, the efficacy of universal prevention programs in terms of effect sizes is typically lower than in selective approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] which has been attributed to different baseline scores in unselected samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Bailey and colleagues summarized the results of 46 trials of universal prevention programs for eating disorders as well as six meta-analytic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Satisfactory effect sizes were observed for outcomes related to eating disorder knowledge while risk factor related outcomes were barely improved. The authors concluded that research opportunities for universal eating disorder prevention could be found in following a cognitive dissonance rather than a psychoeducational approach and by offering interactive interventions in a multi-session format. Another narrative review on effective eating disorder prevention programs underlined the need for universal prevention programs that address both genders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">A most recent randomized controlled trial compared three eight lesson universal prevention programs that addressed females and males with an average age of 13&#x000a0;years and aimed at reducing both eating disorder and obesity risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In one condition most encouraging findings were observed with regard to risk factor reduction in female and male participants (i.e. Media Smart). However, there was evidence of iatrogenic effects of the other two conditions (i.e. Life Smart, HELPP). In these conditions, the authors observed a significant increase of eating concerns and perceived pressure to be thin at the six months follow-up in female participants relative to the control condition (i.e. HELPP) and worsened scores on four eating disorder risk factor variables in female participants as well as worsened scores on three eating disorder risk factor variables in male participants (i.e. Life Smart).</p><p id="Par17">Despite the promising evidence of some universal prevention programs most of these programs do not manage to be transferred from research into classroom practice on the long run [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Current universal prevention programs for eating disorders suffer from several shortcomings. A duration of six to nine weekly lessons is too long to suit the demands of school curricula for each school year. In other cases, scientific evaluations of the programs do not satisfy methodological standards regarding sample size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], randomization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and follow-up assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, in most instances to date, and with some notable expectations (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]) stakeholders including professional organizations that are in regular contact with schools are not yet sufficiently involved in the program development, implementation and dissemination to improve sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Thus, methodologically rigorous efficacy trials of short universal prevention programs which address female and male adolescents and fit the school curricular are urgently needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Against this background, this cluster-randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate the impact of a brief universal prevention program on eating disorder pathology and related risk factors for female and male adolescents. We hypothesized that students who participated in the program would exhibit a significantly greater decrease in eating disorder pathology six months after participation than students who did not participate (primary outcome). We further expected this group difference to emerge directly after participation. Additionally, we hypothesized that students who participated in the intervention would more extensively increase their knowledge of eating disorders, show greater improvements in their self-concept, exhibit less internalization of Western beauty ideals, and report reduced levels of depression and anxiety compared with the outcomes for the control group both immediately after and six months after the intervention. Finally, we performed mediation analyses and subgroup analyses to describe the intervention&#x02019;s effect in subgroups based on age and sex.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and participants</title><p id="Par19">The efficacy of the present eating disorder pathology reduction program was evaluated using a cluster-randomized controlled trial design.</p><p id="Par20">All 144 secondary schools in the city of Hamburg, Germany, were invited to participate.

Thus, participants were recruited from <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;23 secondary schools between February 2012 and July 2014. Eligible participants were students in the 8th or 11th grades (age 14 and 17&#x000a0;years) who provided written informed consent. Additional written informed consent from a parent or legal guardian was required for participants under 16&#x000a0;years of age. Insufficient knowledge of German language was the only exclusion criterion.</p><p id="Par21">The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Psychotherapist Chamber of Hamburg, Germany (July 26, 2011), as well as the Hamburg supervisory school authority. The study protocol has been published (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] or Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> available online), and the study was registered with the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN 97989348).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Randomization</title><p id="Par22">Participating schools were randomized into the study conditions (intervention vs. control) according to the order of application. Randomization was conducted by an external institution (Department of Medical Biometry and Epidemiology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf). Random allocation was performed in a 1:1 ratio stratified by school type (district vs. secondary school) and the socio-economic status of the school environment without blocking. During recruitment, several individual schools were combined with each other due to changes in the Hamburgian school system. As a consequence, the standardized socio-economic indicators of the individual schools were no longer applicable. Thus, random allocation had to be revised, and the result was an imbalance of schools in the study conditions. Once assigned, each school stayed in the same study condition for the entire study duration.</p><p id="Par23">Before providing written informed consent, students and their parents or legal guardians obtained a letter of consent with a detailed description of the allocated study condition. Thus, participants could not be blinded to their study condition.</p><p id="Par24">Participants in the two conditions received neither incentives nor feedback about individual test results. However, participants received a flyer with counselling and assistance services and were given the opportunity to contact a psychotherapist from the research team in case of any mental health issues.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Outcome measures</title><p id="Par25">There were three times of assessment: 1) one month prior to the intervention (baseline), 2) directly after the intervention (post), and 3) six months after the intervention (follow-up). Parallel time points were used for assessments in the control group. At all times of assessment, outcomes were assessed using a questionnaire set with self-report items. At baseline, demographic characteristics and body mass index (BMI) were assessed.</p><p id="Par26">The primary outcome was changes in eating disorder pathology from baseline to the six months follow-up. Following the suggestions by Wilksch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] the global mean score of the children&#x02019;s version of the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (Ch-EDE-Q; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]) was used to assess the primary outcome. The Ch-EDE-Q total score is calculated from the mean score of 22 items which refer to eating disorder symptomatology occurrence in the past 28&#x000a0;days (range 0&#x02013;6, with greater scores indicating more frequent experience of symptoms). The criterion validity of this questionnaire has been demonstrated in multiple studies and languages and there is empirical support from community-based samples for the temporal stability of the EDE-Q subscale scores over five to fourteen months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The inner consistency of the Ch-EDE-Q global mean score in the present sample was Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.955.</p><p id="Par27">The secondary outcome scales included a questionnaire to measure <italic>knowledge about eating disorders</italic> (20 questions covering different aspects of eating disorder risk factors and symptoms, with response options including &#x0201c;right&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;wrong&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;don&#x02019;t know&#x0201d;; range 0&#x02013;20). The <italic>Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire</italic> (SATAQ-G<italic>;</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]) was used to measure three aspects of the internalization of Western beauty ideals.

The inner consistencies of the SATAQ-G subscales ranged between Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.822 (awareness subscale) to .900 (internalization subscale). The <italic>Multidimensional Self-Concept Scale</italic> (MSCS; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]) was used to measure self-concept.

</p><p id="Par29">During the first 90-min-lesson students defined and critically discussed Western beauty ideals for female and male adolescents. This intervention was followed by an individual reflection of own investments to follow beauty ideals and a media literacy intervention focusing on the influence of social media and advertisements on the individual pressure to suit Western beauty ideals and how to cope with this pressure. The first lesson ended with an interactive intervention to help adolescents to cope with pressure from peers and family. One week later, female and male students past the second 90-min-lesson which comprised an interactive nine station parcour which addressed risk factors for eating disorders, protective factors and healthy nutrition (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). At each station, participants were provided with gender-adapted materials, e.g. different instructions for female and male participants. Adolescents passed each station in couples to allow for focused and open discussions. The third lesson directly followed the second lesson and was used to increase students&#x02019; awareness towards local and online help-seeking in case of mental health issues as well as to develop coping strategies for the whole class if a class mate suffers from an eating disorder. A detailed description of the prevention materials and the dissonance-based approach of the prevention program is provided in the study protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The prevention materials were piloted in one school in January 2012. As a result, instructions for some interventions were revised. A prevention manual was then created to standardize the oral and written information during implementation. The intervention was conducted between February 2012 and January 2014.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical methods</title><p id="Par30">The sample size was calculated for the prespecified contrast in the primary outcome, i.e., the adjusted mean difference in the ChEDE-Q change scores between the intervention and control groups from baseline to follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].

With an additional 25% loss to follow-up, a total of 1848 participants needed to be recruited.</p><p id="Par32">We assessed baseline descriptive statistics for all randomly assigned participants by treatment allocation. The primary outcome hypothesis was tested using a random-effects analysis of covariance (ANCOVA; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]) with school as a random factor; with group (intervention vs. control), sex (male vs. female) and grade (8th vs. 11th) as fixed factors; and with baseline eating disorder risk as a continuous covariate using the complete case population at follow-up (although parental educational level appeared in the study protocol, it was not included as a fixed factor because 31% of the participants did not know their parents&#x02019; educational level). The intracluster correlation coefficient, a measure of the heterogeneity of the average responses between schools, was calculated and tested based on the random terms of the model.</p><p id="Par33">In a secondary analysis, we conducted an analogous random-effects repeated-measures ANCOVA at the post-intervention and follow-up points for each prespecified secondary outcome while allowing for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation. In each case, the time of assessment (post, follow-up) was included as a repeated measure, and the significance of the time*group interaction was examined. These secondary analyses were adjusted for the influence of baseline levels from the respective secondary outcome. Preliminary analyses revealed significant differences between students who did not complete follow-up assessments and students who were &#x0201c;completers&#x0201d;. In addition to the control variables documented in the study protocol, BMI and baseline eating disorder risk were included as continuous control variables in all analyses.</p><p id="Par34">As post hoc subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint, a dummy variable including time (post, follow-up) and grade (8th vs. 11th) was coded, and the group*(time/grade) and sex*(time/grade) interactions were analyzed.</p><p id="Par35">An additional secondary analysis aimed to improve the understanding of the interdependencies between the primary and secondary outcomes.

Regarding the primary endpoint, we did not find the expected difference in the change in eating disorder pathology between the intervention and control groups at six months follow-up. Regarding the secondary endpoints, adolescents who participated in the intervention as expected exhibited a persistent and larger increase in knowledge at both times of assessment compared to the control group which is in line with a previous meta-analytic review that observed higher effect sizes for outcomes related to eating disorder knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Additionally, adolescents who participated in the intervention displayed a greater decrease in anxiety post-intervention compared with the control group. In contrast to our expectations, levels of depression and self-esteem were not positively influenced by the intervention. Moreover, the intervention group showed a greater increase in experienced pressure due to the internalization of Western beauty ideals directly after the intervention. This increase might be attributed to the increased awareness towards the presence of and pressure from Western beauty ideals and interpreted as a consequence of cognitive dissonance. Taken together, the present universal prevention program for eating disorders resulted in some positive effects but did not decrease eating disorder pathology. One might argue that this lack of an effect on the primary endpoint might be attributed to the low dosage of the present prevention program. It was the aim of the present project to develop a prevention program with a high likelihood of a long-term implementation in schools. Also, the effects observed in the present study were comparable to those observed in universal prevention programs with a higher dosage (for an overview see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]). Thus, the efficacy of universal prevention programs for eating disorders can not only be attributed to their quantity.</p><p id="Par45">Eating disorder pathology scores of male and female adolescents developed differently in the intervention and control groups as well as in grades 8 and 11. In grade 8 females, an increase in Ch-EDE scores from baseline to post-intervention and six months later was observable in both the intervention and control group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). No such increase in eating disorder pathology could be observed in grade 8 male adolescents from both groups. In contrast to grade 8 adolescents, the decrease in Ch-EDE-Q scores in 11th grade adolescents indicated that this subgroup seem to have benefited from the prevention program with regard to their eating disorder pathology. One explanation for the varying effects of the present program might be that the mechanisms of efficacy are influenced by the age of delivery. In this context, the results of the mediation analyses revealed that in grade 8 changes in eating disorder knowledge significantly mediated the relation between group allocation and changes in eating disorder psychopathology at follow-up. A positive regression coefficient indicated that a knowledge increase was associated with an increase in eating disorder psychopathology. However, a confidence interval very close to zero pointed in the direction that this effect might not be clinically relevant. A similar picture occurred with regard to perceived pressure to suit Western beauty ideals where a significantly mediating effect was observed in grade 8 but not in grade 11. In this age group no such significant mediating effects of eating disorder knowledge or perceived pressure to suit Western beauty ideals could be observed. When one compares the content of the present eating disorder prevention program with those developed by Wilksch and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] it is noteworthy that the prevention program with the most favorable outcome (Media Smart) focused heavily on media internalization, media transported stereotypes and pressure from media whereas the programs with iatrogenic effects focused either on a healthy lifestyle (Life Smart) or included interventions addressing appearance related issues (HELLP). The present program comprised interventions comparable to all three programs. Thus, with regard to participants from grade 8 it seems reasonable for future prevention programs to conduct dismantling investigations to a) examine whether addressing media internalization is truly the most promising approach for universal prevention programs and b) whether it is favorable to focus on a small number of adressed risk factors to ensure that the content is elaborately learned rather than targeting multiple risk factors. On a meta-level our results might provide further evidence that eating disorder knowledge increase should not be an intervention goal and part of primary or secondary endpoints in universal prevention programs that address young adolescents.</p><p id="Par46">The specific effect of the intervention on 11th grade participants may be regarded as significant because an increase in eating disorder pathology has to be expected particularly in late adolescent females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and late adolescence is the peak age of onset for bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Participants from grade 11 differed from grade 8 participants in that in grade 11 anxiety mediated the relation between group allocation and changes in eating disorder psychopathology at post-intervention. This result is in line with previous evidence that identified anxiety as a risk factor for eating disorder symptomatology in female adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Furthermore, in this age group a knowledge increase did not result in an iatrogenic effect and might contribute to greater symptom awareness during later adolescence and facilitated help-seeking behavior in affected individuals and their peers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">Previous studies have shown that prevention programs for adolescents in the eating disorder field tend to be more effective when delivered to females or when solely addressed to either females or males who already show an elevated risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In our view, the applicability of universal prevention programs to entire classes involving both females and males through gender-adapted materials appears to be important. Such an approach can help to increase awareness of eating disorder risk factors, such as peer pressure, thereby decreasing the stigmatization of mental illnesses and improving pro-social behavior in classes for the most relevant peer group during adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, a long term implementation might be facilitated if schools do not need to provide alternative activities for males.</p><p id="Par48">The strengths of our study include a sound study design with cluster randomization and follow-up assessment as well as the high number of participating schools and adolescents. The high practicability of the gender-adapted materials, the brevity of the intervention, and the close cooperation with an established stakeholder of school-based prevention are further strengths of this research.</p><p id="Par49">The results of the study should be interpreted in light of the following limitations. First, individual randomization seemed neither feasible nor appropriate to evaluate the present program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. A cluster randomization of classes would have been more methodologically rigorous given that students within the same school might be more similar than compared with students from other schools. However, participating schools refused a randomization of classes. Cluster randomization with schools as the unit of randomization facilitated the implementation of the intervention and prevented control participants from being unintentionally affected by the intervention. Moreover, we considered it more suitable for students to be in their current peer group, as the present prevention materials comprised several interactive interventions, i.e., group discussions. Second, concealing the allocation of treatment from schools, students or parents was not feasible. This non-blinded allocation might have resulted in an expectancy effect. Allocation to the control group for example might have reduced schools&#x02019; commitment to take part in the study, it might have influenced students&#x02019; responses to the outcome measures and parents&#x02019; behavior towards their children. With the aim to overcome this limitation and to ensure schools&#x02019;, students&#x02019; and parents&#x02019; commitment, the prevention program was offered to participants in the control group after the follow-up assessment. Third, we observed a low response rate of schools who were willing to participate in the present study together with a high attrition rate of schools who consented to participate. This might have decreased the representativeness of our sample in that only particularly motivated schools agreed to participate. It has to be kept in mind, however, that during the implementation of the study important changes in the Hamburgian school system occurred. Many schools which might have been otherwise motivated to participate in the present study were occupied with restructuring activities. Of the participating schools, only one had gone through restricting activities prior to participation. On a more general level, the low response rate of schools highlights the great need to increase the motivation of schools to implement prevention programs. Fourth, the self-report measures were answered during classes; hence, social desirability bias may have affected the completion of these measures. We attempted to limit this potential bias through the attendance of research assistants who ensured that the questionnaires were completed discreetly and quietly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par50">In summary, the present prevention program can be recommended to older adolescents where it resulted in increased knowledge on eating disorders and a decrease in eating disorder pathology. We do believe that knowledge of mental illnesses should be an integral part of education and that prevention programs might also contribute to destigmatization and early detection of mental diseases. Future studies should focus on the evaluation of the present program in grade 11 adolescents and examine the possibility of a teacher- or peer-based delivery of the intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec11"><p>
