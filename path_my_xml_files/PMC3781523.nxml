The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), the combined outcome of serum insulin and glucose levels, is a proxy measure of insulin sensitivity commonly used in epidemiological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). High-fiber and high-polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), high-monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), and low-saturated fatty acid (SFA) fat diets are hypothesized to improve insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Dietary fat intervention studies in adults have shown the beneficial effect of higher unsaturated and lower SFA intake on insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>This study analyzed data from the Special Turku Coronary Risk Factor Intervention Project for Children (STRIP). STRIP is a prospective, randomized trial that was started in infancy and aims to guide the study children toward a diet beneficial for cardiovascular health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Children in the intervention group have had a lower SFA intake from 7 months to 19 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) and a higher dietary fiber intake studied until 9 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). A favorable intervention effect has been found on serum LDL-cholesterol concentrations through infancy to adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). In addition, we have previously reported that the dietary counseling improved insulin sensitivity at 9 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Similarly, in the Dietary Intervention Study for Children (DISC) examining hypercholesterolemic children, benefits of the low-fat and high-fiber dietary intervention given in childhood/adolescence on glycemic control were evident later in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Studies on the effect of dietary intervention on insulin sensitivity and the association of dietary fiber intake and quality of dietary fat with HOMA-IR among repeatedly studied healthy adolescents are, however, nonexisting. We therefore hypothesized that the dietary counseling given in STRIP would be associated with improved insulin sensitivity and that this effect would be explained by differences in fiber intake and/or quality of dietary fat.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>STRIP is a prospective, randomized intervention trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In brief, families of infants 5 months of age were recruited at the well-baby clinics in Turku, Finland, between February 1990 and June 1992. At 7 months of age, 1,062 infants (56.5% of the eligible age cohort) were allocated to an intervention group (<italic>n</italic> = 540) or to a control group (<italic>n</italic> = 522). The intervention and control families both met with a dietitian and a pediatrician/nurse during their study visits. The intervention group received individualized dietary counseling by the counseling team at 1- to 3-month intervals until the child was 2 years of age and twice yearly thereafter until 20 years of age. The child-oriented primary prevention of smoking was introduced at 8 years of age. The detrimental effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke were also discussed. A physically active lifestyle was encouraged, but no physical activity programs were offered to the intervention group. The children in the control group received only a basic health education as routinely given at Finnish well-baby clinics and school health care. The control group was met biannually until 7 years of age and annually thereafter until 20 years of age.</p><p>This study used data from participants between 15 and 20 years of age. Serum insulin and glucose were measured in 245 intervention adolescents (114 girls and 135 boys) and in 273 control adolescents (131 girls and 138 boys) at 15 years of age. At 20 years of age, there were 183 individuals (90 girls and 93 boys) in the intervention group and 225 (116 girls and 109 boys) in the control group. The numbers of participants at other age points are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. The study was approved by the Joint Commission on Ethics of the Turku University and the Turku University Central Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all parents at the beginning of the trial and from the children at 15 years of age.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Characteristics of the intervention (A) and the control (B) girls and boys during the follow-up</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="2952tbl1"/></table-wrap><sec id="s2"><title>Dietary counseling</title><p>Dietary counseling was individualized and designed to meet the Nordic Dietary Recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Dietary changes were suggested based on the child&#x02019;s food records, and topics that were specific to the family were discussed. A fixed diet was never ordered. The main goal was to reduce the intake of SFA and to replace it with unsaturated fat. The child&#x02019;s fat intake was aimed at 30&#x02013;35% of daily energy (E%), with a SFA-to-MUFA+PUFA ratio of 1:2.</p><p>The counseling was based on the age and cognitive ability of the child. From 7 years of age, more dietary information was given directly to the child, who was met alone by the counseling team. A major theme of the dietary counseling also during adolescence was the quality of fat. Use of fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain products (sources of fiber) was encouraged as well. Counseling on how to decrease salt intake began at 8 years of age. The parents were informed of the contents of the adolescent&#x02019;s counseling session and were encouraged to discuss the same diet-related topics at home.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Food records</title><p>Food consumption was recorded using a 4-day food record (consecutive days, at least 1 weekend day included). A dietitian checked the food records for accuracy, and nutrient intakes were analyzed with Micro Nutrica software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) based on the Food and Nutrient Database of the Social Insurance Institution, Finland. The program calculates 66 nutrients in commonly used foods and dishes in Finland. The data bank was continuously updated with new foods and personal recipes. Supplemental vitamins and minerals were not included.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Laboratory methods</title><p>Blood samples were taken annually after an overnight fast for the determination of serum insulin and glucose concentrations. For insulin analyses, the blood samples were centrifuged immediately and 15 &#x000b5;L enzyme inhibitor Antagosan or 30 &#x000b5;L Trasylol (beginning of year 2008) was added to the 0.5-mL serum sample. The samples were stored frozen until analyzed.</p><p>Serum insulin was measured with a microparticle enzyme immunoassay (Insulin IMX system reagent, Abbott, [Chicago, IL], interassay coefficient of variation [CV] 6.5%) or with a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (ARCHITECT insulin assay, Abbott, USA, interassay CV 1.8%). To correct for differences in analytical level between the methods, a correlation equation obtained by standardized principal component analysis of results of samples analyzed with both methods was used. Serum glucose was measured by a hexokinase method (Glucose Olympus System Reagent, Olympus, Ireland, interassay CV 1.8%). To estimate insulin sensitivity, HOMA-IR (fasting insulin mU/mL &#x000d7; [fasting glucose (mmol/L)/22.5]) was calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>Serum samples of cotinine were stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C until analyzed. Cotinine, as a marker of tobacco smoke exposure, was analyzed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Briefly, cotinine was extracted into dichloroethane and analyzed on an Agilent 7890 gas chromatograph (Agilent J &#x00026; W GC Column, Stat Phase HP-FFAP) equipped with a NPD Blos Bead detector. The analytical sensitivity of the method was 0.16 ng/mL. The intra- and interassay CVs at a cotinine concentration of 22 ng/mL were 4.4 and 11.7%, respectively. The interassay CV at a cotinine concentration of 1 ng/mL was 23.3% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Weight, height, pubertal status, and physical activity</title><p>Weight was measured using an S10 electronic scale (Soehnle, Murrhardt, Germany) to the nearest 0.1 kg and height to the nearest 0.1 cm using a Harpender stadiometer (Holtain, Crymych, U.K.). BMI was calculated in kilograms/square of height in meters. Waist circumference (midway between iliac crest and the lowest rib at the midaxillary line) was measured with the flexible measuring tape to the nearest 0.5 cm. Pubertal status was recorded beginning at 9 years of age using Tanner stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Mean duration, frequency, and intensity of habitual leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) was assessed using a self-administered questionnaire at 15, 17, and 19 years of age. LTPA was expressed as a multiple of the resting MET by multiplying the mean frequency, duration, and intensity of weekly LTPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The results are presented as mean &#x000b1; SD or median (interquartile range).

However, to describe the data and to further study the associations, the participants were also divided into three categories according to their energy-adjusted fiber intake, PUFA+MUFA-to-SFA ratio and BMI: low (the lowest 25th percentile), average (50% of adolescents between 25th and 75th percentiles), and high (the highest 25th percentile). To get further insight of the intervention effect on glucose level without confounding puberty-related effects, the association was also examined in the subgroup between 17 and 20 years of age.

The dietary effects of intervention on insulin sensitivity may be complex and therefore not entirely captured by the measured fiber intake and quality of dietary fat. The dietary counseling may also include components that are not measurable by the methods used. The glucose levels were similar in the intervention and control adolescents between 15 and 20 years of age. However, in a subgroup analysis at 17&#x02013;20 years of age, the intervention adolescents had a lower glucose level than the control group adolescents. This suggests that although most of the effect on HOMA-IR is due to changes in insulin levels, small reductions within the normoglycemic range in serum glucose may also play a role.</p><p>Previously, a lower SFA intake was suggested to be the explanation for a part of the HOMA-IR&#x02013;lowering effect of the STRIP intervention at 9 years of age, but the effect of fiber was not studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Among U.S. adolescents and young adults, low fiber consumption has been reported to predict the metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and insulin levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) more strongly than SFA consumption. In the current study, the quality the dietary fat or SFA intake did not significantly associate with HOMA-IR. The energy-adjusted fiber intake was associated with HOMA-IR, but only in girls. One may argue that among the intervention subjects, some individuals exhibited higher insulin sensitivity due to high fiber intake and others due to low SFA intake, making it difficult to analyze statistically the contribution of the two factors in the whole population. Nevertheless, our result may suggest that the intake of dietary fiber could be a stronger determinant of insulin sensitivity than the quality of fat in adolescence. In addition to diet, overweight and obesity are associated with insulin sensitivity, the metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In line, our results indicated a marked effect of BMI and waist circumference on HOMA-IR during the follow-up in adolescence. However, these links did not explain the intervention effect, because there were no significant differences in adiposity between intervention and control groups.</p><p>We have reported that the STRIP intervention decreases SFA intake through childhood to adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). In this study, the higher PUFA+MUFA-to-SFA ratio in the intervention adolescents further indicated the success to replace SFA with unsaturated fat. However, not even the intervention group is at a recommended level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). The intervention adolescents also had higher fiber content in the diet. Although modifying the quality of dietary fat was the main goal of the intervention, suggestions to increase fiber intake were additionally given (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The dietary fat&#x02013;oriented intervention may also have increased the intake of dietary fiber concomitantly, because modification of dietary fat may affect the intake of fiber-rich foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). A high dietary fiber intake may reduce the risk of the metabolic syndrome and development of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The beneficial intervention effect on dietary fiber, in addition to fat quality, may thus have implications for future cardiovascular health.</p><p>A potential limitation of the STRIP study is the possible selection bias in the initial recruitment of the subjects: the participating families might have been more interested in health-related issues than the nonparticipants. However, this would make differences between the study groups even more difficult to find. Although no intervention was given, the dietary habits of the control group may also have been influenced by the regular, annual study visits (e.g., information on cholesterol levels, filling in the food records) and the publicity of the study. Of note is that the intervention group has been met more frequently since 7 years of age than the control group.</p><p>During an extensive study period as in the STRIP, it is inevitable that loss to follow-up occurs. The characteristics of the remaining and discontinuing participants have been repeatedly compared, and no systematic differences have been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The main reasons for loss to follow-up were moving away from the community, recurrent infections, and reluctance to undergo blood sampling. As a consequence, it is unlikely that a systematic bias has influenced the results, and therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the results would be applicable to the general pediatric population.</p><p>Because the STRIP intervention also included other counseling in addition to low-saturated-fat dietary counseling, it is difficult to dissect the distinct beneficial components of the intervention on insulin sensitivity. Another limitation is that the data did not allow us to study the separate effects of cereal and fruit/vegetable fiber on HOMA-IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). The use of a subjective method to study diet may have hampered the detection of significant associations between diet and insulin sensitivity. Further, HOMA-IR instead of more complex methods, such as the euglycemic clamp technique, was used to indicate insulin sensitivity, and LTPA was not assessed annually. However, fasting insulin level and HOMA-IR correlate in nondiabetic subjects relatively well with insulin sensitivity determined by the clamp technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>).</p><p>Major strengths of the study are the long follow-up period in adolescence, the sample size, and the use of well-established methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Beneficial intervention effects on insulin sensitivity were found in healthy adolescents during a challenging period of puberty when own food choices are made increasingly more often.</p><p>In conclusion, the favorable effect of the STRIP intervention on insulin sensitivity extends from childhood to pubertal age and further into early adulthood. The results of the study further justify the recent Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) and recommendations of American Academy of Pediatrics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) for healthy children in incremental type 2 diabetes prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). The results show that dietary and cardiometabolic risk factor changes can be introduced in adolescence through intervention. Future studies will determine the long-term effects of STRIP intervention on insulin sensitivity in later adulthood.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
