Standard evaluations often encompass objective hearing tests only, while patients&#x02019; subjective experiences gain importance in today&#x02019;s healthcare. The aim of the current study was to analyze the correlation between subjective (self-reported questionnaires) and objective (speech perception and localization) hearing test results in adult cochlear implant (CI) users. Secondary, the correlation between subjective and objective hearing tests was compared between bilateral and unilateral CI patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Data for this study were prospectively collected as part of a multicentre randomized controlled trial. Thirty-eight postlingually deafened adult patients were randomly allocated to receive either unilateral (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;19) or bilateral (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;19) cochlear implantation. We used data gathered after one year of follow-up. We studied the correlation between objectively measured speech perception and localization skills on the one hand and related domains of the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale (SSQ) and Nijmegen Cochlear Implant Questionnaire (NCIQ) on the other hand.

Although unilateral cochlear implantation still is the standard treatment in most countries, an increasing amount of patients worldwide is being implanted bilaterally in order to improve (spatial) hearing skills and speech understanding in noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">The eligibility criteria for cochlear implantation are constantly changing and the quality and possibilities of cochlear implants (CIs) are growing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In this world of new developments, assessing hearing performance after cochlear implantation is vital. There are various methods to do this. In many CI centres, evaluations encompass objective hearing tests only. Clinically applied speech perception and localization tests are robust and reliable, but time-consuming and it is questionable if these test conditions fully represent everyday listening situations. Subjective tests (self-reported questionnaires) are easy to administer and a large set of data can be gathered in a short period of time. Also, in today&#x02019;s healthcare, a patients&#x02019; subjective experiences gain importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. For example, when the cost-effectiveness of a treatment is analyzed, health related quality of life questionnaires are often used to measure the effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, questions can be misinterpreted and missing values easily occur when patients do not fill out (parts of) the questionnaires.</p><p id="Par22">Literature has shown that there are often discrepancies between subjective and objective hearing test results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Previous studies were mainly about the correlation between subjective and objective speech perception tests. The amount of literature on correlations between subjective and objective localization tests is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">There is an ongoing global discussion on whether or not bilateral cochlear implantation should be standard care for bilateral deafness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The current literature on correlations between subjective and objective tests however, only includes unilateral and bimodal CI users. Correlations between tests might be different for unilateral and bilateral CI users, due to differences in test sensitivity or differences in indicating their own performance. Therefore, the latter is worth investigating.</p><p id="Par24">The current study is a subanalysis of a previous published study on the comparison of bilateral and unilateral cochlear implantation in adult patients with bilateral postlingual deafness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Key findings</title><p id="Par47">In this study, we found significant correlations between subjective and objective hearing test results in adult CI users. The strongest correlation was found between the spatial domain of the SSQ and the objective localization test (<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.59, a moderate correlation). The other correlations, between subjective and objective speech perception in noise test results, were weak to moderate. There could be several reasons for the lack of strong correlations between subjective and objective results. Perhaps the questionnaires and objective tests do not represent the same hearing skills. Another reason could be that the patients&#x02019; views of their own hearing skills did not match their actual hearing capabilities. Therefore, it seems important to evaluate both subjectively and objectively measured hearing skills after cochlear implantation.</p><p id="Par48">When we compared the outcomes of the unilateral and bilateral CI group, all correlations in the bilateral CI group were stronger than in the unilateral group, although none of the correlations differed statistically significant from each other. We cannot rule out that the latter is the result of the small sample size: 19 patients in each group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Comparison with the literature</title><p id="Par49">A recently published meta-analysis reviewed the correlation between different types of (subjective) hearing-specific and CI-specific questionnaires and (objective) speech perception scores in CI patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Thirteen studies were included. These studies showed low correlations between hearing-specific and CI-specific questionnaires on the one hand and objective speech perception scores on the other hand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The pooled correlation between CI-specific questionnaire scores (for example NCIQ) and speech perception in noise was weak (<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.26, <italic>p</italic>:0.0064). Other studies, not included in the meta-analysis, also found predominantly weak to moderate correlations between subjective and objective speech perception tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In a study of Hirschfelder et al. subjective and objective hearing tests were compared in 56 unilateral CI users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. They found significant weak to moderate (<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.28&#x02013;0.56) correlations between the NCIQ total score, the NCIQ advanced sound perception, the NCIQ speech production domains and both objective speech perception tests (Freiburger monosyllable test in quiet and Hochmair, Schulz, Mozer (HSM) sentence test in noise). Damen et al. studied 69 postlingually deafened adult patients (59 unilaterally implanted and 10 non-implanted) and found significant correlations between the NCIQ total score and two Dutch standardized speech perception tests in quiet (the Antwerp-Nijmegen syllable (<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.48) and the NVA phoneme test (<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.32)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In a study of Brendel et al. the Everyday Listening Questionnaire (ELQ) 2 was significantly correlated to objective speech perception tests (Monosyllables, HSM in quiet and HSM in noise), but the strength of the correlations was not mentioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. To date, only one study included objective spatial hearing tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Heo et al. reviewed the correlation between all domains of the SSQ and objective speech perception and localization tests in 14 unilateral CI recipients with a contralateral HA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The spatial domain of the SSQ was significantly correlated with the environmental sound localization (<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.57) and perception (<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.55) scores. The quality domain was significantly correlated with all perception scores (<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.54&#x02013;0.66) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. To our knowledge, there is no&#x000a0;previous literature on the differences in correlations between bilateral and unilateral CI patients.</p><p id="Par50">A drawback of some of the previous studies is the lack of clear hypotheses. That has resulted in the presentation of multiple random correlations between objective test scores and questionnaire scores without clear clinical relevance. Also, the authors did not correct for multiple testing. Nevertheless, our findings are in agreement with the previous literature, and our study methodologically fills the gaps of previously mentioned studies. We chose to study only clinically relevant relations by combining (parts of the) subjective tests with corresponding objective tests. To minimise the chance of finding incidental results we corrected for multiple testing. Another strength of our study is the use of prospectively collected data. All participants had completed the questionnaires one year after implantation and had performed the objective tests within the same week. None of the participants were lost to follow-up and we did not have any missing data. Also, to our knowledge our study is the first to investigate correlations between subjective and objective test results in bilateral CI patients. A weakness of the study is the small sample size. This might be the reason why we found some insignificant results after correcting for multiple testing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par51">In this study, correlations between subjective and objective speech perception and spatial hearing tests were weak to moderate, but significant, in adult CI patients. The correlation between subjective and objective hearing tests seemed not different for bilateral compared to unilateral CI patients. This study elucidates the importance and necessity of questionnaires in the evaluation of cochlear implantation. Also it shows that patients may experience their own hearing performance differently than objective tests would suggest. Therefore, it is advised to use both objective and subjective tests in cochlear implant patients on a regular basis.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p id="Par6">Cochlear implant</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>dB SPL</term><def><p id="Par7">Decibel, sound pressure level</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ELQ</term><def><p id="Par8">Everyday listening questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HA</term><def><p id="Par9">Hearing aid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HSM</term><def><p id="Par10">Hochmair, Schulz, Mozer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IQR</term><def><p id="Par11">Interquartile range</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NCIQ</term><def><p id="Par12">Nijmegen cochlear implant questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NVA</term><def><p id="Par13">Nederlandse Vereniging voor Audiologie (Dutch association for Audiology)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SISSS</term><def><p id="Par14">The speech-intelligibility test with spatially separated sources</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SNR</term><def><p id="Par15">Signal-to-noise ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SRTn</term><def><p id="Par16">Speech reception threshold in noise</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SSQ</term><def><p id="Par17">Speech, spatial and qualities of hearing scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>U-STARR</term><def><p id="Par18">Utrecht Sentence Test with Adaptive Randomized Roving levels</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p id="Par19">Visual analogue scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank all patients included in this trial.
