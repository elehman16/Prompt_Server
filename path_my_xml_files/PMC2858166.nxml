This analysis explored relationships between various baseline characteristics and changes in lipids and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in the presence/absence of MetS in the Vytorin versus Atorvastatin in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypercholesterolemia (VYTAL) study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>This was a post hoc analysis of the randomized double-blind 6-week VYTAL study in 1,229 type 2 diabetic patients with hypercholesterolemia who received ezetimibe/simvastatin (10/20 mg/day) versus atorvastatin (10 and 20 mg/day) or 10/40 mg ezetimibe/simvastatin versus 40 mg atorvastatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Type 2 diabetic patients, 18&#x02013;80 years, with A1C levels &#x02264;8.5%, triglycerides &#x02264;4.52 mmol/l, and LDL cholesterol levels &#x02265;2.59 mmol/l were included.</p><p>This analysis was performed in randomized patients who had baseline and one or more postbaseline measurements (modified-intent-to-treat population) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Prespecified baseline factors found significant by univariate analysis for association with week 6 percent changes from baseline in lipids and hs-CRP were assessed in multivariable linear regression models using continuous and categorical variables in separate analyses. Factors were identified for inclusion in the final model using a model-based variable deletion process. Triglycerides and hs-CRP were analyzed in this model using normal-score rank transformations for percent changes. Proportions of patients attaining prespecified LDL cholesterol levels (&#x0003c;1.81 and &#x0003c;2.59 mmol/l) were assessed using similar logistic regression models.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Baseline characteristics and levels of efficacy parameters at baseline and study end are provided in the online appendix (supplementary Tables A and B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dc09-1762/DC1">http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dc09-1762/DC1</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Baseline factors found to be significant predictors of percent change by univariate analysis (supplementary Table C) were further assessed by multivariable analysis. Results of the analyses of baseline predictors on percent changes from baseline are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and supplementary Fig. S1 (categorical) and supplementary Table D (continuous). Increasing age was significantly related to all efficacy parameters analyzed except hs-CRP. Patients aged &#x02265;65 vs. &#x0003c;65 years had greater reductions from baseline in LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and triglycerides; better LDL cholesterol target attainment; and larger HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I increases. Black/Hispanic patients had smaller LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B reductions and less LDL cholesterol target attainment than white/other races/ethnicities. Men had greater triglyceride and non-HDL cholesterol reductions than women. Higher baseline LDL cholesterol was associated with greater reductions in most lipids as well as smaller HDL cholesterol increases and triglyceride reductions and increasing baseline non-HDL cholesterol with improvements in HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Higher baseline HDL cholesterol was related to greater non-HDL cholesterol and hs-CRP reductions and smaller HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I increases. Patients with higher baseline non-HDL cholesterol or triglycerides attained LDL cholesterol targets less frequently. Higher baseline hs-CRP levels were related to smaller LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B reductions and larger hs-CRP reductions. Higher baseline BMI was associated with smaller HDL cholesterol increases and hs-CRP reductions and higher baseline A1C with smaller apolipoprotein B reductions. The presence of MetS had no effect. Ezetimibe/simvastatin treatment (versus atorvastatin) was associated with significantly greater improvements in all efficacy variables.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Multivariable association of categorical factors with the percent change from baseline in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) (<italic>A</italic>), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) (<italic>B</italic>), non&#x02013;HDL cholesterol (<italic>C</italic>), and apolipoprotein B (<italic>D</italic>). <italic>P</italic> values (*<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, **<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01, ***<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) in <italic>A&#x02013;D</italic> correspond to the significance of marked (*) category compared with lowest category for the variable.

These effects were not attributable to differences in study therapy adherence, which was high for both age (98.1&#x02013;98.2%) and race/ethnicity (95.9&#x02013;98.7%) subgroups. Alterations in LDL metabolism (e.g., diminished VLDL particle production) may account for the more robust therapeutic LDL cholesterol lowering in older patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Attenuated LDL cholesterol&#x02013;lowering responses in black patients after statin treatment have been linked to single-nucleotide polymorphisms in HMG-CoA reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The age-associated HDL cholesterol increases observed in this study may reflect altered HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux and/or other physiological functions in older patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>The diminished LDL cholesterol&#x02013;lowering response observed in hypertriglyceridemic patients may be attributed to the increased prevalence of small dense LDL particles in these patients that bind less effectively to LDL receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Higher baseline HDL cholesterol levels were negatively related to percent change from baseline in HDL cholesterol, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Whether MetS provides greater clinical value than its individual components is debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In this analysis, factors that contribute to MetS (BMI, A1C, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol) and the inflammatory marker hs-CRP were significant predictors of lipid changes; however, MetS itself was not related to treatment responses, although there were relatively few subjects without MetS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Higher baseline hs-CRP levels were associated with attenuated LDL cholesterol lowering, an effect not previously noted to our knowledge, and perhaps related to heightened levels of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Obesity-related changes in HDL cholesterol metabolism may account for the smaller HDL cholesterol increases associated with higher BMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Because adipose tissue inflammation in obese patients may strongly influence hs-CRP levels, smaller hs-CRP reductions observed in obese patients could reflect lesser statin effectiveness in suppressing adipose versus vascular sources of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The association between increasing baseline A1C and smaller apolipoprotein B reductions may be related to the presence of small dense LDL particles in these patients that vary inversely with A1C levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>When considered cumulatively, the baseline factors positive for treatment response, namely age &#x02265;65 years, baseline triglycerides &#x0003c;1.7 mmol/l, baseline non-HDL cholesterol &#x0003c;4.14 mmol/l, and race/ethnicity other than black/Hispanic, predicted attainment of LDL cholesterol &#x0003c;1.81 mmol/l irrespective of treatment. These results indicated that black or Hispanic subjects, individuals aged &#x0003c;65 years, and patients with elevated triglycerides and non-HDL cholesterol levels may require more intensive therapy to attain LDL cholesterol goal than patients without these factors.</p><p>It should be noted this exploratory analysis had limited statistical power, and some observations may have been influenced by chance variation because of multiple comparisons. Nonetheless, several observations, notably the impact of age and race/ethnicity, are consistent with previous statin studies. In summary, patient-related characteristics can influence efficacy in type 2 diabetic patients with hypercholesterolemia after ezetimibe/simvastatin and atorvastatin treatment. These factors, and particularly the collective presence of positive predictors, should be considered in planning lipid-altering therapies in these patients.</p></sec>
