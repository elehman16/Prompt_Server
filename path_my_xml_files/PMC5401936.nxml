COPD causes severe social psychosocial harm to patients because it cannot be treated over years (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Self-efficacy of emotion regulation is an important index that evaluates confidence level and social competence of regulating individual emotion (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), and COPD patients need to well control the acute exacerbation process of the disease, meanwhile, keeping good emotion regulation ability and being positive and confident are very important (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Chronic disease self-management program has achieved successful application in education management of disease such as stroke, asthma, chronic bronchitis, and hypertension (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), but there are few reports in terms of self-management intervention studies of COPD.</p><p>This study investigated self-management program intervention of COPD patients in order to provide scientific evidence for COPD patients in terms of health care and treatment.

For control group, there were 26 males and 17 females; their ages were between 44 and 78 years old and average was 62.6 &#x000b1; 13.5 years old; their course of disease was 1&#x0223c;8 year(s) and average was 3.2 &#x000b1; 1.3 years; their education time was 13&#x0223c;24 years and average was 18.6 &#x000b1; 4.4 years. For observation group, there were 24 males and 19 females; their ages were between 45 and 76 years old and average was 61.8 &#x000b1; 14.5 years old; their course of disease was 1.5&#x0223c;10 years and the average was 3.5 &#x000b1; 1.4 years; their education time was 12&#x0223c;25 years and average was 17.6 &#x000b1; 4.8 years. Baseline documents of two groups were comparable.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study method</title><p>Conventional out-of-hospital continued nursing mode was applied in control group, including establishing individual profile, regular follow-up phone call; guiding and supervising regular medicine intake outside the hospital such as Bronchodilators inhaled through mouth, glucocorticoid drugs, antibiotics and medicine relieving cough and asthma; guiding healthy lifestyle such as proper exercise, strengthening physique, preventing cold, quitting smoking and not actively or passively having secondhand smoke; long-term home oxygen therapy or community-based rehabilitation therapy could be applied for patients who had such conditions, evaluating symptoms and degree of COPD regularly and offering preventive suggestions and correct solutions for acute onset.</p><p>Strengthened self-management program guidance was used in observation group (including seven modules and they were disease knowledge, breathing exercises, emotion management, home oxygen therapy, medicine intake technique, healthy life behaviors, and action plans in deterioration stage). First, St George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire testing and COPD health knowledge questionnaire were used. Medicine treatment shall be according to investigation conclusion and patients&#x02019; diseases severity. Meanwhile, personalized self-management program intervention scheme and related course guidelines would be prepared by respiration medicine experts and specialized nurses. Specialized nurses and nursing staff from community health service center shall establish long-term communication mechanism with patients and visit them regularly, guiding their self-management and pointing out and correcting mistakes in time. They can use books and videos to demonstrate and explain to patients and let patients practice repeatedly till they have acquired above knowledge and skills. Follow-up visit shall be once a week and 1.5 h each time, and then it shall be changed to follow-up phone calls 8 weeks later and the course of intervention is 6 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Observation indexes</title><p>To evaluate the differences of self-management behaviors before intervention and last 6 months with scale scores of self-efficacy of emotion regulation. For self-management behavior, evaluation was carried out in accordance with self-management behavior questionnaire and scoring standards and Chronic Self-management Study Measurement Table (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>); questionnaire included three quantitative indexes and they were exercise training, cognitive symptom management practice, and medical care with 15 items in total; five-grading system (0&#x02013;4 points) was used for exercise training measurement table and six-grading system (0&#x02013;5 points) was used for the other two. Total score of measurement table was according to the average score of items, the higher the score was, the more effective the self-management behavior was. Self-efficacy of emotion regulation evaluation used SRESE measurement table (Caprara 2008 Edition) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), including three dimensions and they were perceived self-efficacy in expressing positive affect (POS), perceived self-efficacy in managing despondency/distress (DES), and perceived self-efficacy in managing anger/irritation (ANG). There were 12 items in questionnaire and 5-point scoring system (1&#x02013;5 points) was used. Total score was the sum of scores in all dimensions. The higher the score was, the better the self-efficacy of emotion regulation was.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical method</title><p>SPSS 19.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used in data analysis;

Therefore, efficacy of emotion regulation is significant in COPD treatment.</p><p>Self-management behavior refers to behaviors that prevent diseases from development, monitor signs of disease and improve life quality, long-term good self-management behaviors are good for developing healthy lifestyles, increasing adaptive behaviors, relieving discomfort symptoms and even improving body&#x02019;s immune function (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Self-management program intervention can help COPD patients learn disease management knowledge and skills as well as improving patients&#x02019; positive attitude toward disease, which has been widely approved by medical circles home and abroad (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). COPD is hard to treat, so patients are easily getting anxious, depressed, negative and disappointed, which are reasons why COPD patients cannot positively face their diseases and they &#x0201c;surrender&#x0201d; to it. This will surely prevent them from developing effective disease management behaviors and furthermore, influence self-efficacy of emotion regulation and improvement of life quality (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). It has been revealed in the study (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) that for follow-up visits of COPD patients discharged from the hospital for half a year, the incidence rates of acute exacerbation have increased, which are significantly related to poor self-efficacy of emotion regulation. In this study, efficacy scores of emotion regulation for patients in two groups are low, indicating that COPD patients have significant problems in regulating depression/pain/anger emotions. With great improvement of self-management behaviors in observation group, its self-efficacy of emotion regulation has also increased significantly and all indexes are getting better when patients discharge from hospital compared with control group. It indicates that self-management program intervention can help patients face disease positively, motivate their potentials, and improve disease management ability in order to improve their life quality and self-efficacy of emotion regulation.</p><p>In addition, organizing chronic disease self-management in form of groups is good for arousing the enthusiasm and interactivity of patients, which is able to improve significantly clinical prognosis (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Due to the particularity of COPD disease, patients suffer for a long-time torment and most of them have severe asthma after activity, but it is hard to gather them and educate. Therefore, in this study, individualized education and face-to-face guidance are combined in observation group with family visit, which is easy for patients to accept, the guidance is more complete and thorough, and it helps patients solve psychosocial problems better (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Self-management program intervention is the most potential treatment resource in recovery indexes of COPD patients, which guides patients to carry out rehabilitation exercise and disease management in stable phase actively and effectively according to schemes and is good for improvement of self-efficacy of emotion regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Ethical issues (Including plagiarism, informed consent, misconduct, data fabrication and/or falsification, double publication and/or submission, redundancy, etc.) have been completely observed by the authors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
