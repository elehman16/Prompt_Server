fertilization (IVF) cycles. Before reaching this point, the selected embryos go
through a series of events that might compromise their development and viability.
One of the most remarkable is the days spent in culture medium environment.</p><p>Avoiding multiple gestation pregnancies is one of the most complex challenges faced
in assisted reproductive technology therapies, which makes it necessary to extend
the culture to the blastocyst stage to improve the odds of selecting good embryos,
since early embryo development is inefficient and only a few zygotes eventually
reach the blastocyst stage. In other words, embryos reaching the blastocyst stage
undergo spontaneous selection in culture medium (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">Sep&#x000fa;lveda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">Gardner &#x00026; Lane, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">Blake
<italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Evidence suggests that higher
pregnancy rates are achieved when embryos are transferred in the blastocyst stage
rather than in the cleavage stage (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">Milki <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2000</xref>).</p><p>The dynamic nature of early embryo development and the changes in the in vivo
environment led to the formulation of sequential culture medium approaches designed
to support embryos from the zygote to the blastocyst stage (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">Macklon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Sequential culture
medium approaches are based on the use of two culture media consecutively to support
embryo development. The first contains pyruvate to provide the energy needed in the
early stages of embryo development and cleavage, while the second contains glucose
to meet the energy demands of blastocyst formation (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">Hardy <italic>et al</italic>., 1989</xref>).</p><p>Single culture medium approaches provide embryos with all nutrients needed for them
to grow. Single culture medium has produced superior outcomes when compared to
sequential culture medium, not only in terms of improved pregnancy rates but also in
reference to the quality of the blastocysts obtained (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">Sep&#x000fa;lveda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">Biggers &#x00026; Racowsky, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">Macklon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Comparisons between the two approaches have found that single culture medium yielded
better outcomes in assisted reproductive technology therapies in the form of
improved pregnancy rates and blastocyst formation (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">Vermilyea <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). The option of not renewing the
culture medium on day 3 has been proposed to avoid the manipulation of embryos in
culture, but significant differences have not been found yet (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">Costa-Borges <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">Rambhia &#x00026; Desai, 2014</xref>). Therefore, the
present study aimed to assess the effect of growing embryos to the blastocyst stage
without renewing the culture medium on day 3.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The study was carried out in the Laboratory of Assisted Reproduction of
Cl&#x000ed;nica Miraflores in the period ranging from April to December of 2016. The
study included 589 human embryos obtained from 82 couples submitted to IVF/ICSI with
donor oocytes. The couples were randomly divided into two groups: group 1 (medium
renewed on day 3) and group 2 (medium not renewed on day 3).</p><sec><title>Ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrieval</title><p>For ovarian stimulation a dose of 150 to 300 IU/day of FSH and/or HMG was used
during the first two to five days of the cycle based on patient age, body mass
index, and response to previous stimulation. Dosage was adjusted according to
ultrasound examination performed in intervals of two to three days. The patients
were given GnRH antagonists and stimulation continued until the main follicles
reached a mean diameter of 18mm. To trigger ovulation, human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG) or a GnRH agonist was administered; ovarian puncture was
performed 36 hours later. Each patient received a mean of 8.4 donor oocytes.
Severe male factor infertility was an exclusion criterion.</p></sec><sec><title>Insemination and embryo culture</title><p>After ovarian puncture the oocytes were cultured in Global Total medium
(LifeGlobal<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) at 37&#x000b0;C, 5.5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 5.0%
O<sub>2</sub> for 4.5 hours. Then the oocytes were inseminated by
conventional IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The oocytes
inseminated by ICSI were denuded from cumulus cells by pipetting into
Hyaluronidase 80 IU/ml (Fertipro<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) and washed in Global Total
medium with HEPES (LifeGlobal<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). The metaphase II oocytes were
injected with spermatozoa previously immobilized in PVP (Fertipro
<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). After ICSI the oocytes were cultured in Global Total
medium (LifeGlobal<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) covered with 10ml of mineral oil
(Fertipro<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) for 5 to 6 days until transfer or
vitrification. The oocytes inseminated by conventional IVF were kept in Global
Total medium for fertilization (LifeGlobal<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) at a
concentration of 90,000 to 100,000 sperm per milliliter until the time of
fertilization evaluation. Fertilization was evaluated approximately 18 hours
after insemination. All cases were evaluated on day 3. Cases requiring medium
renewal on day 3 were transferred to their new plates previously prepared with
Global Total medium covered with mineral oil, while the cases without medium
renewal were returned to the incubator after embryo assessment on day 3.</p></sec><sec><title>Embryo assessment and selection for transfer</title><p>Embryo assessment was performed on day 3 including the following morphological
parameters: number of blastomeres, degree of fragmentation, and symmetry between
blastomeres. The blastocysts were assessed based on the ASEBIR classification
system, which includes internal cell mass, trophectoderm, and degree of
expansion of the blastocele. The blastocysts considered to be of good quality
were selected for transfer, while the remaining ones that did not show signs of
arrest or were of poorer quality were vitrified. All transfers occurred on day 5
of development with embryos in the blastocyst stage.</p></sec><sec><title>Endometrial preparation for recipients</title><p>Patients with ovarian function were treated with intramuscular Leuprolide Acetate
3.75 mg on day 21 of the cycle preceding the IVF treatment. On the third day of
the cycle, oral estradiol valerate 2 mg was administered for 5 days, followed by
4 mg daily for 5 days, and then 6mg daily as maintenance therapy. Menstruation
was induced in patients without ovarian function through hormone replacement
therapy; estradiol valerate was administered on day 3 of the treatment as
described above.</p><p>To achieve luteal support, 1000mg/day of micronized Progesterone was administered
vaginally to all recipients on the day of fertilization of the donor
oocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The chi-square test was used to compare proportions, while the Student's t-test
was used to compare quantities following a normal distribution. Statistical
significance was ascribed to differences with a
<italic>p</italic>-value&#x0003c;0.05. The Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences 24.0 (SPSS Inc.) was used in data analysis and interpretation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The 689 metaphase II oocytes used in this study yielded 589 fertilized oocytes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The oocytes had been divided into two
groups, one featuring oocytes cultured in medium renewed on day 3 and another with
oocytes cultured in single medium without renewal. Significant differences were not
found in fertilization (83.02% vs. 87.60%), blastocyst formation (59.47% vs. 58.77%)
or implantation (49.32% vs. 50.00%) rates.</p><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Embryo cultures with and without renewal</p></caption><table frame="box" rules="all"><colgroup span="1"><col width="20%" span="1"/><col width="20%" span="1"/><col width="20%" span="1"/><col width="20%" span="1"/><col width="20%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Clinical results</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total (%)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">With renewal (%)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Without renewal (%)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>p-value</italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n&#x000ba; of patients</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">82</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">38</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">44</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">-</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n&#x000ba; of mature oocytes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">689</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">318</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">371</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.901</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fertilization rate (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">589 (85.49)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">264 (83.02)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">325 (87.60)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.256</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Blastocyst development (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">348 (59.08)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">157 (59.47)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">191 (58.77)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.269</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n&#x000ba; of transferred embryos</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">159</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">73</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">86</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.725</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Positive <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-hCG (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">54 (65.85)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24 (63.16)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30 (68.18)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.632</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Clinical pregnancy rate (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">51 (62.2)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22 (57.89)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29 (65.91)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.455</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Implantation rate&#x000a0; (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">79 (49.69)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36 (49.32)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">43 (50.00)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.330</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>One hundred and fifty-nine blastocysts were transferred in the two groups combined,

without renewal on day 3 offered practical and physiological advantages over culture
in single medium with renewal (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">Costa-Borges
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">Biggers
&#x00026; Summers, 2008</xref>). IVF laboratories performing these procedures must
comply with strict requirements to control the conditions to which embryo cultures
are exposed, including temperature variations, light, and O<sub>2</sub> and
CO<sub>2</sub> pressure (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">Cohen <italic>et
al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). It is also important to control for substances
that might affect the development of the embryos, such as dust particles, VOC, and
disinfectants.</p><p>Some authors have not found significant differences in pregnancy or implantation
rates when comparing cultures with and without medium renewal (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">Costa-Borges <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">Rambhia &#x00026; Desai, 2014</xref>). Similarly, our
results did not reveal statistically significant differences when the two groups
were compared, although increases of 8% in clinical pregnancy and 5% in positive
pregnancy rates were observed (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-hCG).</p><p>Many authors have agreed that uninterrupted cultures produce more blastocysts for
transfer or vitrification (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">Reed <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">Vermilyea
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Even authors unable to find
significant differences in pregnancy rates between the two methods (with or without
medium renewal) have agreed that the blastocyst formation rate from uninterrupted
cultures in single medium is significantly higher than that of embryo cultures with
medium renewal on day 3 (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">Rambhia &#x00026; Desai,
2014</xref>). Our results did not evince such pattern. The number of blastocysts
available was not different from cultures with medium renewal, showing that single
medium culture without medium renewal did not decrease the quality of the culture
procedure, although it improved other parameters.</p><p>The application of this method might not only improve pregnancy rates as shown in
previous studies, but also prevent the introduction of contaminants into the
culture. Furthermore, it might decrease the stress caused to embryos by pipetting
and variations in temperature and pH (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">Reed
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Avoiding embryo manipulation is a top
priority in <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures to mitigate possible epigenetic risks
(<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">Velez de la Calle <italic>et al.</italic>,
2013</xref>).</p><p>The design of this study would have been improved if a cohort of sibling oocytes had
been used. This measure would have allowed comparisons not only between patients,
but also between embryos in the same cohort, removing the bias generated by
circumstances occurring in the laboratory during the investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The results obtained in this study did not reveal statistically significant
differences between cultures with and without medium renewal for the assessed
parameters. However, a non-significant trend favoring cultures without medium
renewal was observed in clinical pregnancy and positive pregnancy rates
(<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-hCG).</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors wish to thank Vannia Salazar, Jonathan V&#x000e1;squez, Bel&#x000e9;n
