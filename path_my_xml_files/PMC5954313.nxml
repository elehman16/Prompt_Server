No specific selection criteria were required, only availability and willingness to participate were required. Residents were recruited through e-mail, flyers, and word of mouth.

Prior to each session, participants were asked to complete 2 free online modules through the Ohio State University (OSU) College of Medicine&#x02019;s Mind-Body Skills Training for Resilience, Effectiveness, and Mindfulness. This series consists of 12 total online modules, and 8 were chosen for this intervention, based on in-person session content and relevance to residency training. As an incentive, residents were offered 1.5&#x02009;hours (for each skills session) and 1&#x02009;hour (for each module) of lecture credits, which are tracked by the residency program. Skills sessions focused on open discussion of module content, sharing of participants&#x02019; mindfulness learning experiences between sessions, and hands-on teaching of MBST techniques, with most of the session time devoted to practice of the skills (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2382120518773061">Table 1</xref>). Participants were encouraged to make an individual &#x0201c;mindfulness plan&#x0201d; for continuing their skills practice. For the following 6&#x02009;months, the residents were offered optional monthly &#x0201c;maintenance&#x0201d; group sessions, with the opportunity to join remotely via online group video chat. Maintenance sessions were informal, peer-led, group sessions to discuss mindfulness plans, use of skills, situational relevance, barriers, and overall use of MSBT. Participants were also welcome to discuss any other topic related to mindfulness or their MBST experiences.</p><table-wrap id="table1-2382120518773061" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>In-person session description with corresponding online modules and participant participation.</p></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2382120518773061-table1"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Session</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Module titles (no. completed)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Class content (no. of participants)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.

Participants were grouped into dosage tertile (low, medium, and high). Interestingly, the low-dose group completely comprised junior residents (PGY-2), and the high-dose group comprised only senior residents (PGY-3 and PGY-4). Only one PGY-4 medicine-pediatric resident attended the course and was therefore denoted as a PGY-3 in the data to protect the participant&#x02019;s identification. Low-dose participants often showed the most significant initial improvement on all scales with the exception of self-compassion, however, did not maintain improvement as often as the high-dose participants. Overall, the least amount of improvement was noted in the Neff&#x02019;s Self Compassion measure in both statistical analyses and qualitative trends. The low-dose cohort showed no improvement in self-compassion scores and even worsened in some; in the higher dose cohorts, scores were frequently unchanged but rarely improved.</p><table-wrap id="table5-2382120518773061" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 5.</label><caption><p>Comparison of burnout, perceives stress, self-compassion, mindfulness, and resilience from time 1 to time 2.</p></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2382120518773061-table5"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Time 1<hr/></th><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Time 2<hr/></th><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">n</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">

At T2, participants were also asked to comment on the values of the course and ways in which the course and its leader could improve. Participants noted that the course helped them in various ways such as providing &#x0201c;ideas on ways to manage stress&#x0201d; and being &#x0201c;mindful in everyday activities&#x0201d; &#x0201c;including work,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;tak[ing] care of myself,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;enjoy[ing] the moment [and] hav[ing] a greater sense of gratitude.&#x0201d; One participant acknowledged the helpful information and background provided by the modules, but that the in-person classes were &#x0201c;best for actually practicing.&#x0201d; Individuals disagreed on the ideal timing of the in-person sessions with one desiring longer sessions, another suggesting shorter but more frequent sessions, and yet another noting having difficulty in making all the sessions as scheduled.

These results compare favorably with those seen with larger investments of training time and facilitator expertise.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2382120518773061" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="bibr12-2382120518773061" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr13-2382120518773061" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> As hypothesized, the approach used in this study was practical and feasible: 75% of the residents completed at least 2 sessions and 4 online modules, and most found the course worthwhile. Most believed the intervention helped in mastering concepts to improve mindfulness in daily life, and specifically, that the leader helped them apply the skills to resident life. Successful leadership of the class by a peer resident with no professional training was critical to the feasibility (cost and availability) of the program. Finally, we hypothesized that this short course could decrease burnout and stress and increase resilience and self-compassion using multiple validated measures. With exception of self-compassion scores, all other scores showed definitive improvement either immediately following conclusion of the course (T1 to T2) or at the 6-month follow-up (T1-T3). It is important to note that some factors, such as stress, rebounded back to the baseline levels over the 6&#x02009;months, suggesting that methods for reinforcement of these concepts and skills should be part of future work in this area. The MBI is an established, validated measure for burnout, and these findings are encouraging, suggesting the positive impact of such a brief &#x0201c;low-dose&#x0201d; MBST course on these important components of burnout and resident wellness. It is even more remarkable that such benefits were detected with such a small sample size.</p><p>Interestingly, the participants self-selected into dosage groups that reflected their year of residency training. The junior residents (PGY-2) made up the &#x0201c;low-dose&#x0201d; cohort exclusively, as well as 2 of the 3 individuals in the &#x0201c;medium dose.&#x0201d; The &#x0201c;high-dose&#x0201d; cohort was exclusively senior residents (PGY-3 or PGY-4). Possible explanations for this self-selected dosage finding are that the senior residents may have felt more commitment to the course because they knew the facilitator as a close peer, or they were more committed to resilience training because they had more personal experience with burnout during their residency.</p><p>The small sample size of this study is the biggest limitation. Low participation was likely multifactorial, and could have been influenced by lack of interest or comfort with MBST, lack of time, and/or difficult or busy clinical rotations. In addition, self-selection of motivated, interested participants without a control group may have contributed to the positive findings. Because the intervention was completed in July, it may be relevant to note that the junior residents had completed their intern year immediately prior to the intervention. Their initial scores may reflect the stress accumulated over their intern year, or, alternatively, they may have felt a sense of renewal and accomplishment by having recently completed their internship. Also, most residents were on an elective rotation or block with protected study time during the intervention, and none were on an inpatient ward rotation; this could be a confounding factor as they may have had decreased burnout scores regardless of intervention.</p><p>Despite less exposure, the low-dose cohort demonstrated more dramatic improvements in comparison with the higher dose group on wellness outcomes. Improvements may be a reflection of these participants having more extreme initial scores which afforded more opportunity for improvement. Alternatively, these participants may have responded more positively to the intervention due to lack of previous experience in self-taught resiliency skills. Senior resident score changes may have been less dramatic yet better maintained over time due to familiarity and comfort with residency experience and accompanying resilience at baseline. The lack of maintenance of improvement may be a reflection of a lower dosage having a less sustained effect. This outcome lends support in suggesting that maintenance courses or &#x0201c;booster doses&#x0201d; are indeed necessary for sustained success across all dosages.</p><p>It is perplexing that self-compassion scores were muted, even statistically worsened, at T3, especially for the junior residents. These results suggest that self-compassion may be a particularly difficult concept to both apply and master in a short period of time. Also, it is possible that high-achieving individuals, such as physicians, may have difficulty with not easily succeeding in a new skill, paradoxically leading to self-judgment and deprecation.</p><p>The lack of formal and standardized training of the peer resident facilitator is both a strength and weakness of this intervention, as future applications of this course at both the original institution and others hinge on replicating and sustaining effective leadership. There are few examples of peer-led MBST programs in medical education but this may be a powerful approach for this subset of participants.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2382120518773061" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="bibr22-2382120518773061" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr23-2382120518773061" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>Finally, the participants found it difficult to make the optional monthly postcourse maintenance sessions with only 2 attending the first 2 sessions; no further sessions were held after that. Maintenance sessions were 1&#x02009;hour, and attempts were made for these to be held at different times of the day (mornings, noon time, and late afternoons) to accommodate varying residents&#x02019; schedules. This suggests that this degree of commitment in follow-up is not feasible with resident schedules and would likely require protected time for more reliable participation. In postcourse evaluation feedback, the reinforcement sessions were identified as too difficult to organize around the participants&#x02019; variable schedules outside of work-hours and that there was no incentive to complete this &#x0201c;optional&#x0201d; portion of the program.</p><p>Larger trials will be needed to fully assess the usefulness of this intervention, evaluate the impact of dose of treatment, and clarify the minimum number of sessions needed to sustain beneficial effects. A primary limitation was the lack of a control group, which will be essential to future studies. Power was another limitation of the study, with only a small number of residents completing all ratings for each time point. Booster doses of mindfulness training, or promotion of &#x0201c;apps&#x0201d; or other mindfulness prompts, may also be useful educational methods. Shorter, more frequent classes devoted to developing MBST may be just as effective or even more effective in future educational efforts. The difficulty of organizing and implementing maintenance group sessions should prompt further investigation into different methods of sustaining the impact of a MBST course over time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section22-2382120518773061"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This pilot study demonstrates that a peer-led, short mixed-method mindfulness-based skills course may be a practical way to offer resilience and stress management training and improve wellness in busy pediatric residents.
