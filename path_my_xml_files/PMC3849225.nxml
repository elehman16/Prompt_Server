By design, all participants were overweight or obese, but entry weight tended to be slightly lower in older participants, and a smaller proportion of older participants was obese (73% of those over 60 compared to 81% in those 50 or younger). Eligibility criteria required all participants to have hypertension and/or dyslipidemia, and the majority were being treated for hypertension. Those over 50 were more likely to be taking lipid-lowering medication than were younger participants. However, in general, entry characteristics were comparable across age groups. We observed qualitatively similar results among the subset of 1032 participants who were randomized into Phase II, of whom 272, 471, and 289 were in each age group, respectively.</p><p id="P27"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows Phase I weight loss by age group.

During Phase I, older participants tended to show less improvement in these behaviors, potentially because they tended to have better levels at entry. Otherwise, there were no significant associations between age and behavior change during Phase I or Phase II.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S15"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P31">In WLM, adults age &#x0003e; 60 years had greater initial weight loss, less weight regain, greater sustained weight loss, and a higher proportion with clinically significant weight loss after 3 years compared to younger adults. Older adults had greater weight loss in response to both personal counseling and to an internet-based intervention.</p><p id="P32">These findings are consistent with the main results of the WLM trial<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> in that PC was associated with greater weight loss maintenance than IT. However, it is notable that older individuals had greater weight loss than younger individuals in both interventions. It is clear that this is an intervention effect rather than a reflection that older individuals will sustain more weight loss under any circumstances: without any maintenance intervention (i.e., in the SD group), older and younger participants experienced similar low levels of weight loss maintenance. Despite popular perceptions, an internet-based intervention was effective in older adults, assuming that they had some familiarity with the internet to begin with (an eligibility criterion for WLM).</p><p id="P33">Clearly, weight loss is achievable and sustainable in older adults. Such a goal seems desirable based on the known benefits of weight loss for prevention and control of CVD risk factors. These benefits appear to occur regardless of age. For example, in the Look AHEAD trial, in which the mean age is 59 years (sd 6.8), weight loss at both 1 and 4 years was associated with improved control of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Similarly, in the TONE trial, with mean age 66, a behavioral weight loss intervention reduced the need for pharmacologic antihypertensive treatment by 30%.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p id="P34">There may be additional benefits of weight loss in older adults. For example, although somewhat controversial, obesity in older adults is associated with increased risk of dementia in some studies<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, raising the possibility that weight loss can slow cognitive decline. A recent trial in older adults suggests that weight loss coupled with exercise prevents decline in physical functioning and preserves bone mass.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Observations of increased mortality associated with lower body weight in older adults (the putative &#x0201c;obesity paradox&#x0201d;)<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> have been mitigated by a recent cohort study indicating that moderate-to-severe obesity is indeed associated with higher mortality, at least for whites.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> In addition, in a secondary analysis of the ADAPT trial in older adults, randomization to a weight loss intervention was associated with reduced mortality.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> There is additional evidence of potential benefit.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup></p><p id="P35">Nonetheless, questions remain concerning the beneficial and potentially harmful effects of weight loss in older adults and whether the degree of overweight/obesity has varying impact by age.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> WLM (nor any other trial) did not directly test the effects of weight loss on health outcomes. However, because weight loss in older adults has known beneficial effects on a wide range of risk factors and potential effects on other health outcomes, . the preponderance of evidence suggests that weight loss will lead to health benefits that outweigh potential health risks. However, this hypothesis should be directly tested.</p><p id="P36">When considering implementation of weight loss intervention in older adults, the success of the IT intervention in older WLM participants is particularly encouraging since this intervention can be efficiently scaled for broad dissemination. Furthermore, , we found that consistent use of the internet intervention was more likely among older than younger participants, and was associated with greater weight loss maintenance.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>Although some have expressed concern about the use of technology-based solutions in older adults, our data suggest just the opposite. Currently 46% of US adults age 65 or older report regular use of the internet.<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Therefore, internet-based intervention holds great promise for this age group. However, it is important to bear in mind that all WLM participants received a 6-month intensive behavioral intervention conducted in facilitated group sessions before randomization to SD, IT or PC. Therefore, we cannot speculate about the effects of an internet-based intervention that is implemented without initial weight loss through a more traditional face-to-face intervention.</p><p id="P37">Potential limitations of our study include the difficulty in understanding the biological or behavioral mechanism(s) of the observations. We did not see differences in key behaviors other than greater attendance and self-monitoring in Phase I (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), but measures of diet and physical activity are imprecise. Alternatively, there may be other behavioral, biological and environmental factors that may contribute to the observed age differences. In addition, we did not measure body composition. If older adults preferentially lose lean rather than fat mass, the health benefits of weight loss may be attenuated. Finally, we chose age categories (age 50 years or younger, 51&#x02013;60 years, and over 60 years) that allowed us to compare groups of roughly equal size. However, other categories would have facilitated comparisons to other studies and/or been more relevant to health care delivery (e.g. if one category corresponded to Medicare&#x02019;s age of eligibility) or if we had assessed a category comprising the very old. The latter option was not feasible since there were only two participants who were &#x0003e;80 years old . In sensitivity analyses in which the age categories were defined as &#x0003c;65, 65&#x02013;74, and &#x0003e;=75 (with N = 868, 149, and 15 randomized participants, respectively), results were similar to our primary analysis.</p><p id="P38">Nonetheless, our results indicate that older adults can lose weight with behavioral intervention and then sustain weight loss using <italic>either</italic> personal counseling <italic>or</italic> internet technology. In the absence of any maintenance intervention, more weight regain occurred, indicating that further intervention is needed after initial weight loss. Ideally, we need trials powered to determine effects of weight loss on clinical outcomes in older adults. But given the range of risk factors favorably affected by weight loss in older adults, future research should determine optimal strategies, including internet-based strategies, for increasing intervention effects and for broad implementation in older adults.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="conflict"><p id="P39"><bold>Conflict of interest</bold></p><p id="P40">The authors have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn id="FN2" fn-type="con"><p id="P41">Author contributions: LPS, KF, JFH, JFA, PJB, CML, CMC, WMV and VJS were involved in study design.
