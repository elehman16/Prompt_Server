The trial was therefore discontinued early. There was no indication of more favorable outcomes for combination therapy in secondary efficacy end points. As expected, the safety and toxicity profile of the combination therapy was less favorable compared to monotherapy. Overall, this trial did not demonstrate that adding sorafenib to second- or third-line paclitaxel provides any clinical benefit to patients with HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Cautious dosing using a sorafenib ramp up schedule might have contributed to negative results.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">The study was registered at EudraCT (No 2009&#x02013;018025-73) and retrospectively registered at Clinical trials.gov on March 17, 2011 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=2009-018025-73">NCT01320111</ext-link>).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Metastatic breast cancer</kwd><kwd>Paclitaxel</kwd><kwd>Sorafenib</kwd><kwd>Antineoplastic agents/chemotherapy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004326</institution-id><institution>Bayer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par22">Breast cancer accounts for the greatest number of all new cases of cancer in women both in America and in Europe. Whereas the number of new cases of breast cancer has been increasing since 1980, mortality has been slightly decreasing in part because of improvements in primary treatment modalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Nevertheless, once metastatic disease is established, the therapeutic strategy is seldom curative with median survival ranging from 2 to 3&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Recently, substantial progress has been made in HER2-positive disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and in overcoming endocrine resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], but when it comes to the application of chemotherapy in HER2-negative disease, sequential use of single agents is still the therapy of choice because of increased toxicities in combination regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">The choice of the first line agent depends on previous adjuvant treatment, the need to induce a remission and patient preference regarding possible side effects. Taxans or anthracyclines are considered to be a standard of care, but a variety of other agents are frequently given because of toxicity or pretreatment issues. Disease control can be achieved in the majority of patients albeit for a limited amount of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">Attempts to improve these results by adding agents targeting angiogenesis have been modestly successful. Bevacizumab, an antiangiogenic antibody, improves tumor response and progression free survival (PFS) when added to a variety of chemotherapeutic agents in the first-line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] or second-line setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Similar results have been recently published with ramucirumab, another monoclonal antibody targeting the VEGF pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Although chemotherapy is usually administered in the second-line setting, response rates are low with overall survival being less than 18&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Sorafenib (Nexavar&#x000ae;) is a multikinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic and antiproliferative properties and is widely used in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular and renal cell carcinomas. Although clinical significant improvements were reported, toxicities were substantial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Preclinical data in breast cancer models have shown additive/synergistic effects by adding sorafenib to cytotoxic drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Early studies demonstrated limited efficacy but reasonable tolerability of sorafenib when used as a single agent in metastatic breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, promising results were published when sorafenib was combined with capecitabine in first-line or second-line treatment in a randomized phase IIb trial. Whereas overall survival and objective response rates were not improved, a significant and potentially clinical relevant difference in PFS was described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Because of overlapping toxicities (hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR), diarrhea), the combination of capecitabine and sorafenib resulted in unacceptable toxicities. Combined treatment with sorafenib and paclitaxel was also tested in the first line setting in a phase IIb trial. Although the primary endpoint (prolongation of PFS) was not met, disease control was improved. Toxicities were substantial but manageable with dose reductions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Therefore, we initiated this trial of sorafenib in combination with paclitaxel and started with a sorafenib dose of 200&#x000a0;mg bid which was gradually escalated to 400&#x000a0;mg bid within the first 3&#x000a0;cycles to avoid early toxicities. The safety and efficacy results of a pre-planned interim analysis of the PASO trial in patients receiving second- or third-line treatment are reported here.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par30">Written informed consent was given by all patients before enrolment. All patients had to meet the following inclusion criteria: Patients were female and age 18 or older, with HER-2-negative locally recurrent (inoperable) or metastatic breast cancer with an indication for second- or third-line chemotherapy. An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0 or 1 was required. Prior endocrine or radiation therapy was allowed as well as treatment with taxanes in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. Pretreatment with bevacizumab was also allowed. Anticancer chemotherapy, hormontherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy had to be terminated at least 3&#x000a0;weeks prior to study entry. Patients were ineligible if they had known brain metastasis, inadequate bone marrow, liver or kidney function, previous or concurrent cancer, or had a significant risk for major cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events. HER2 status was determined using ICH or FISH/CISH test. Response was evaluated based on RECIST 1.1 by the investigators. Patients were followed up for toxicity, progression free survival and death until 12&#x000a0;months after the last patient ended study treatment.</p><p id="Par31">All procedures performed in this study were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.

Patients were randomly assigned to the respective treatment arms. Prior to randomization, patients were stratified by second- and third-line treatment as well as by possible pre-treatment with bevacizumab. Randomization was performed in a 1:1 ratio using sequential numbers, which were randomly allocated to one of the treatment arms. Paclitaxel was given at 80&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> as one-hour i.v. infusion on day 1, 8, 15 and sorafenib 400&#x000a0;mg orally twice daily (bid) taken continuously throughout 28-day cycles. Treatment was administered until tumor progression or until unacceptable toxicity. Sorafenib was to be started as 200&#x000a0;mg in the morning and 200&#x000a0;mg in the evening (cycle 1), increased to 200&#x000a0;mg in the morning and 400&#x000a0;mg in the evening (cycle 2) and further increased to the maintenance dose of 400&#x000a0;mg in the morning and 400&#x000a0;mg in the evening (from cycle 3). Specific dose reduction schedules were recommended for hematological/non-hematological toxicities and HFSR.</p><p id="Par33">The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).

As patients in second- and third-line treatment were included in the study, a PFS of 4&#x000a0;months was assumed for the control arm (single-agent paclitaxel). Improvement by 50% to a median PFS of 6&#x000a0;months in the test arm (paclitaxel-sorafenib combination) was considered to be clinically significant. A total of 110 events were required to detect a difference in median PFS of 4 vs. 6&#x000a0;months (one-sided test, &#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.1, 80% power). Assuming a recruitment period of 12&#x000a0;months and a follow-up period of a further 12&#x000a0;months, a total sample size of 122 patients was required. To account for a drop-out rate of about 15% a total of 140 patients were planned to be randomized.</p><p id="Par36">Analysis of efficacy was conducted based on the intent-to-treat (ITT) principle.

Although many lines of chemotherapy are commonly administered, the actual benefit of treatment for patients receiving second- and further-line therapy are hard to quantify [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and only limited progress has been reported in this setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par53">Attempts to improve results by combining chemotherapy with antiangiogenic drugs targeting the VEGF pathway have resulted in conflicting results. In general, modest gains in progression free survival and response rates did not translate into improved overall survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">Sorafenib is a potent multikinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic and antiproliferative properties and therefore has a broader spectrum of activity than bevacizumab. It does not only target the VEGF-2 receptor, but also the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-&#x000df;, c-Kit, Flt and Raf kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">The objective of PASO, a randomized controlled phase II study, was to demonstrate the superiority of paclitaxel-sorafenib combination therapy over paclitaxel monotherapy in second- or third-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. However, the trial was terminated early after a pre-planned interim analysis has shown that the treatment effect was statistically in favor of paclitaxel monotherapy.</p><p id="Par56">In the PASO trial, paclitaxel was chosen because of non-overlapping toxicities with sorafenib and its established clinical efficacy in metastatic breast cancer. Although current guidelines recommend taxan-based chemotherapy early in the course of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], taxanes are often used in clinical practice in later treatment lines to avoid alopecia and long standing neuropathy (N. Marschner, manuscript in preparation). Combination of chemotherapy and sorafenib has been reported to result in additional toxicities and frequent dose interruptions and reductions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. To avoid excessive toxicities of the combination therapy, sorafenib dose was gradually increased according to a prespecified ramp up schedule. Using this schedule, sorafenib dose could be increased gradually from 407&#x000a0;mg during cycle 1 to 630&#x000a0;mg in cycle 3, with frequent doses modifications due to toxicity. However, toxicities were rather modestly increased in patients receiving combination therapy with increases in leukopenia, mucositis and diarrhea. Especially the incidence of grade 3 HFSR was rather low compared to the incidence of HFSR with paclitaxel and sorafenib started at full dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Importantly, early occurrence of HFSR has been described to be a predictive factor for tumor control in hepatocellular carcinoma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par57">In order to manage or prevent toxicities, the investigators of the PASO trial did not fully utilize the recommended dose of 800&#x000a0;mg (400&#x000a0;mg twice daily). As a result of such cautious dosing, a number of patients received sorafenib in a potentially subtherapeutic range, with a possible impact on clinical efficacy outcomes. A similar dose escalation strategy was reported in a neoadjuvant phase II trial. Cumulative sorafenib doses between 37% and 65% of the recommended dose of 800&#x000a0;mg daily were given depending on the treatment schedule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par58">In an attempt to alleviate the toxicities of the capecitabine and sorafenib combination, the phase III RESILIENCE trial also started with a lower sorafenib dose, which could be escalated to 400&#x000a0;mg BID if tolerated. In addition, detailed guidelines for prophylactic and symptomatic treatment were provided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In contrast to promising data from the phase II SOLTI trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] the addition of sorafenib to capecitabine did not meet the primary endpoint of prolonging progression free survival. There even was a trend for lower overall survival. The reduced starting dose of Sorafenib might have contributed to these inferior outcomes as in our trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Hypothetically, the growth enhancing effect of sorafenib at lower doses might have contributed to these results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par59">Indeed, treatment with sorafenib should be initiated with the approved dose of 400&#x000a0;mg bid in hepatocellular cancer as evidence is lacking from real world non interventional studies that lower starting doses result in equivalent outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In addition, there was a trend of reduced OS survival in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer treated with a lower sorafenib dose (30 versus 56&#x000a0;months, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.08) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par60">The reduced starting dose could therefore explain the inferior outcome in our study as compared to the study by Gradishar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Addition of sorafenib to paclitaxel improved disease control and overall response in this study although PFS or OS were not significantly prolonged. Importantly, sorafenib was started full dose at 400&#x000a0;mg bid. In addition, while treatment delays and dose reductions are only slightly more frequent in Arm B, paclitaxel was not administered much more often in Arm B. These differences imply that in addition to a reduced sorafenib dosing, also paclitaxel application was not conducted according to the preplanned schedule. This might also have contributed to a superior result of Arm A.</p><p id="Par61">Although the two treatment groups were generally balanced with respect to their clinical characteristics as assessed at screening, some negative prognostic factors were not evenly attributed. First, lung, thorax and brain were more frequently affected by metastases in Arm B than in Arm A. Second, in patients receiving combination therapy, there appeared to be more organs affected: At least 2 organs in 21 patients (70%) compared with 16 patients (53%) who received standard therapy. Third, patients who also received sorafenib tended to be more impaired in activities of daily living. At screening, all patients treated had a Karnofski performance status &#x02265;70%, i.e. were ECOG 0 or 1. However, the proportion of patients who were restricted in physically strenuous activity (ECOG 1) was higher in Arm B: 11 patients (39%) versus 7 patients (24%) in Arm A. In addition, previous treatment with paclitaxel or docetaxel as part of adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy was more frequent in patients in the experimental arm (33,3% vs 23,3%). In view of the small sample, the numerical disparity was not explored statistically, but an influence on outcome cannot be excluded. A large number of patients were pretreated with bevacizumab in our trial (more than 70% in both treatment arms). This raises the concern of a possible cross resistance between bevacizumab and sorafenib, which both target the VEGF receptor pathway, However, clinical data in renal cancer demonstrates that treatment with the multi-kinase inhibitor sunitinib is efficacious in patients previously treated with bevacizumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In addition, continued targeting of the VEGF receptor pathway beyond progression was associated with clinical benefit in a variety of cancer types including breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par62">Another limitation of our study is related to design. For reasons of practicality, it was conducted open label without placebo added to paclitaxel in Arm A. Moreover, tumor response was evaluated by the investigators and not additionally by blinded independent centralized review. However, it is regarded as very unlikely that such design features would have impacted the overall conclusions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par63">In summary, the PASO trial adds data to the growing evidence, that addition of sorafenib to chemotherapy in unselected patients with metastatic breast cancer should not be further explored as a therapeutic strategy in this group of patients. The ramp up design resulted in a favorable toxicity but the inferior outcome in the combination arm raises the question of &#x0201c;starting right&#x0201d;. In the absence of prospective randomized data, reduced starting doses of targeted agents should not be routinely administered.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AEs</term><def><p id="Par6">Adverse events</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p id="Par7">Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CR</term><def><p id="Par8">Complete response</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECOG</term><def><p id="Par9">Eastern cooperative oncology group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HER2</term><def><p id="Par10">Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HFSR</term><def><p id="Par11">Hand-foot skin reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p id="Par12">Intent-to treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NCI-CTCAE</term><def><p id="Par13">National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ORR</term><def><p id="Par14">Overall response rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OS</term><def><p id="Par15">Overall survival</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PFS</term><def><p id="Par16">Progression free survival</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PR</term><def><p id="Par17">Partial response</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TTP</term><def><p id="Par18">Time to progression</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TTT</term><def><p id="Par19">Time to next treatment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VEGF</term><def><p id="Par20">Vascular endothelial growth factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WBC</term><def><p id="Par21">White blood cell</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par64">The study was sponsored by GMIHO (Gesellschaft f&#x000fc;r Medizinische Innovation &#x02013; H&#x000e4;matologie und Onkologie mbH) and supported by Bayer.
