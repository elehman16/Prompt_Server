Cognitive functions change throughout life. Some cognitive functions such as executive functions and working memory reach a peak in 20&#x02032;s or 30&#x02032;s <xref rid="pone.0055518-Blakemore1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Other cognitive functions such as semantic knowledge develop to the age of 60 or 70 <xref rid="pone.0055518-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Most cognitive functions of young adults at around 20 years of age do not reach the peak <xref rid="pone.0055518-Luna1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Schaie1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Baltes1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-DeLuca1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Thus, improvements of cognitive functions by cognitive training in younger adults as well as in older adults are attracting attention. Video game training is cognitive training of one type <xref rid="pone.0055518-Boot1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Nouchi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Video game training has attracted much attention because some video game training shows that effects of playing certain types of games have led to improvement of performances of other untrained tasks, which is commonly designated as a transfer effect <xref rid="pone.0055518-Boot1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Lovden1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Takeuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Boot2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The transfer effect was defined as &#x0201c;the ability to extend what has been learned in one context to new contexts&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0055518-Bransford1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In the research fields of cognitive training using video games, the improvements of cognitive functions through playing video games were referred to as transfer effects <xref rid="pone.0055518-Boot1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Nouchi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Boot2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-McDougall1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Miller2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In line with these results, commercial brain training games of many types (e.g., <italic>Brain Age</italic>, <italic>Big Brain Academy</italic>, and <italic>Brain Challenge</italic>) have been released. Such commercial brain training games have become popular around the world. The beneficial effects of these brain training games are expected to improve cognitive functions. However, a recent massive internet-based research of adults aged 18&#x02013;60 demonstrated that brain training games of a certain type had no transfer effect on any other cognitive function <xref rid="pone.0055518-Owen1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. For young adults, the beneficial effects of the commercial brain training games have little scientific basis. Investigation of transfer effects from commercial brain training games on cognitive functions is just beginning <xref rid="pone.0055518-Nouchi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-McDougall1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Miller2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Recent studies show that the effects of playing commercial brain training games such as <italic>Brain Age</italic>, published by Nintendo Co. Ltd., can lead improvement in the accuracy and speed of calculations in healthy children <xref rid="pone.0055518-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Miller2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and can improve executive functions and processing speed in healthy elderly people <xref rid="pone.0055518-Nouchi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-McDougall1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. These results demonstrated that commercial brain training games, especially <italic>Brain Age</italic>, have a transfer effect in healthy children and healthy elderly people. However, it remains unclear whether the effects of playing the commercial brain training game transfer to cognitive functions in healthy young adults. Previous studies have showed that younger adults have a great possibility of improvement of cognitive functions through performing cognitive training and playing video games compared to older adults <xref rid="pone.0055518-Lovden1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Brehmer1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Dahlin1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Dahlin2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Schmiedek1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Shing1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. These earlier results indicate that the effects of playing the brain training game can transfer to the cognitive functions in young adults.</p><p>It should be noted that cognitive performances improved after playing classic and recent videogames. For instance, playing the classic video games such as <italic>Tetris</italic>, Donkey Kong and Pac Man improved the reaction times <xref rid="pone.0055518-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Goldstein1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Moreover, playing the recent action video games such as Medal of Honor improved visuo-spatial and attentional skills <xref rid="pone.0055518-Boot2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Thus, to prove the beneficial effects of the brain training game, it should necessary to compare improvement of cognitive functions after playing brain training games with that after playing other types of video games. In the present study, we selected <italic>Brain Age</italic> as the brain training game and <italic>Tetris</italic> as other types of video games for the reasons that these games were famous and easy to play. The further reasons why we used <italic>Brain Age</italic> and <italic>Tetris</italic> were described more fully in the method section.</p><p>This study investigated the beneficial transfer effects of a commercial brain training game on cognitive functions in the healthy young adults. To examine this issue, we conducted a de facto (double-blinded) intervention <xref rid="pone.0055518-Berger1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> with two parallel groups (a brain training group and an active control group). The de facto intervention <xref rid="pone.0055518-Berger1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> was a kind of double-blinded intervention which participants and testers were kept blind to the experimental hypothesis. The participants were asked to perform each type of video game training (<italic>Brain Age</italic> or <italic>Tetris</italic>) over 4 weeks with at least 5 training days in each week. On each training day, participants used the video game for about 15 min. This procedure was identical to that used in a previous intervention study of elderly people <xref rid="pone.0055518-Nouchi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>To evaluate the transfer effects of the commercial brain training game on cognitive functions, we assessed a broad range of cognitive functions (fluid intelligence, executive functions, working memory, short-term memory, attention, processing speed, visuo-spatial ability, and reading ability). Fluid intelligence was measured using Raven&#x02019;s Advanced Progressive Matrices Test (RAPMT) <xref rid="pone.0055518-Raven1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Executive functions were measured using Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) <xref rid="pone.0055518-Piper1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, and Stroop Task (ST) <xref rid="pone.0055518-Hakoda1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Working memory was measured using Operation Span (OpS) <xref rid="pone.0055518-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, letter&#x02013;number sequence (LNS) <xref rid="pone.0055518-Wechsler1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, and arithmetic (Ari) <xref rid="pone.0055518-Wechsler1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Short-term memory was measured using Digit Span (DS) <xref rid="pone.0055518-Wechsler1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and Spatial Span (SpS) <xref rid="pone.0055518-Wechsler2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Attention was measured using the Digit Cancellation Task (D-CAT) <xref rid="pone.0055518-Hatta1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and Simple Reaction Time (SRT) <xref rid="pone.0055518-Sano1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Processing speed was measured using Digit Symbol Coding (Cd) <xref rid="pone.0055518-Wechsler1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and Symbol Search (SS) <xref rid="pone.0055518-Wechsler1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Visuo-spatial ability was measured using the Mental Rotation task (MR) <xref rid="pone.0055518-Shepard1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Reading (verbal) ability was measured using the Japanese Reading Test (JART) <xref rid="pone.0055518-Matsuoka1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>Based on previous studies <xref rid="pone.0055518-Nouchi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-McDougall1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Miller2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Goldstein1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, we expected that playing video games would improve cognitive functions and the beneficial effects of video games on cognitive functions would differ according to the types of video games (<italic>Brain Age</italic> and <italic>Tetris</italic>). Moreover, we made three specific hypotheses related to improvements of cognitive functions after playing video games. First, playing <italic>Brain Age</italic> would lead to improve executive functions and processing speed compared with playing <italic>Tetris</italic>. The reason was that the previous study using <italic>Brain Age</italic> in the older adults showed improvements of executive functions and processing speed <xref rid="pone.0055518-Nouchi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Second, playing <italic>Brain Age</italic> would improve working memory. Previous study showed that working memory was highly correlated with executive functions and processing speeds <xref rid="pone.0055518-Miyake1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-McCabe1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Because playing <italic>Brain Age</italic> improved executive functions and processing speed <xref rid="pone.0055518-Nouchi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, playing <italic>Brain Age</italic> would improve working memory in the same way. Thirdly, playing <italic>Tetris</italic> would improve the visuo-spatial ability and the attention compared with plying <italic>Brain Age</italic>. The previous study using <italic>Tetris</italic> demonstrated the improvements of the visuo-spatial ability and attention through playing <italic>Tetris</italic>

On each training day, participants performed the video game for about 15 min. We used <italic>Brain Age</italic> (Nintendo Co. Ltd.) as a game that participants in the brain training group played. We used <italic>Tetris</italic> (Nintendo) as a game that participants in the active control group played. The participants played video games on a portable console, Nintendo DSi (Nintendo Co. Ltd.), at home. The game performance was recorded for each participant. Nintendo DSi did not have functions to record the playing time and the playing date. Therefore, all participants were provided 1) a stopwatch which can record the playing time each training day and 2) a timer which informed the participants of the practice time (15 minutes). Participants used the stopwatch and the timer to keep to the practice time limit. At the end of each training day, participants reported the scores of the played games and the total practice time in a training diary. The <italic>Brain Age</italic> group listed the titles of trained games and a score for each trained game at the end of each training day. The <italic>Tetris</italic> group reported the best total score, total lines, and the final level at the end of each training day.</p><p>After the intervention period, we checked whether or not the practice time which participants reported in the training diary matched the actual practice time which were recorded in the stopwatch. Most practice times which participants reported were consistent with the actual practice times in the stopwatch. We used the actual practice time to estimate an average practice time. The average practice times in each training day were 15.85 minutes (SD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.49) in the <italic>Brain Age</italic> group and 15.92 minutes (SD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.37) in the <italic>Tetris</italic> group. There was no significant difference of the practice time between the <italic>Brain Age</italic> and the <italic>Tetris</italic> groups (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003e;0.1). This result suggested that the participants kept to the practice time (about 15minutes).</p><p>The measures of cognitive functions were conducted before and after training. On the first day of training (pre), all participants were tested on a series of neuropsychological and behavioral tests. After these tests, participants received instructions to play one of the games for 30 min. The following day, participants started 4 weeks of video game training. After 4 weeks of training (post), all participants were re-examined to assess their performance on some neuropsychological and behavioral tests. Finally, the portable console and the video game were returned at the end of the study.</p><p>We selected <italic>Brain Age</italic> because 1) <italic>Brain Age</italic> was one of the most popular brain training games in the world, 2) <italic>Brain Age</italic> was developed based on knowledge of neuroscience and psychological evidence <xref rid="pone.0055518-Kawashima1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Uchida1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, and 3) results of previous studies indicated the beneficial effects of playing <italic>Brain Age</italic> on cognitive functions <xref rid="pone.0055518-Nouchi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-McDougall1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Miller2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.

The previous study used reading aloud and simple arithmetic calculations as training tasks. There were some reasons why we selected these tasks. First, we hypothesized that activations of the association cortices by cognitive tasks may well improve regional cerebral blood flow and change brain activities and brain structures, which lead to improve the function of these cortices <xref rid="pone.0055518-Takeuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Uchida1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Takeuchi2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Second, we focused on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, because the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is related to higher cognitive functions such as executive function, working memory and processing speed <xref rid="pone.0055518-Curtis1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Carpenter1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Alvarez1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Sweet1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Usui1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>.

Finally, these tasks were simple. Most games in <italic>Brain Age</italic> include elements of these reading aloud and simple arithmetic calculations.</p><p>
<italic>Brain Age</italic> includes nine games. Based on a previous study <xref rid="pone.0055518-Nouchi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, we used eight training games and avoided use of <italic>Voice Calculation</italic> because <italic>Voice Calculation</italic> is similar to <italic>Calculation&#x000d7;20</italic> and <italic>Calculation&#x000d7;100</italic>. 1) In <italic>Calculation&#x000d7;20</italic>, participants must answer 20 simple arithmetic calculations as quickly as possible. The questions include problems of mathematical addition, subtraction, and multiplication. 2) In <italic>Calculation&#x000d7;100</italic>, participants must answer 100 questions as quickly as possible. The questions include problems of mathematical addition, subtraction, and multiplication. 3) In <italic>Reading Aloud</italic>, participants must read aloud excerpts from Japanese classical literature. 4) In <italic>Syllable Count</italic>, some sentences written in a combination kanji and kana are presented. Participants must count the kana letters after translating kanji to kana. 5) In <italic>Low to High</italic>, numbers in boxes are first presented for a few seconds. Then participants must select the boxes from the lowest number to the highest number. 6) In <italic>Head Count</italic>, participants watch scenes in which some people enter or leave a house. Then participants must state the number of people in the house at the end. 7) In <italic>Triangle Math</italic>, three numbers are presented on a top line (e.g., 5, 7, 2), with two mathematical operations presented on a second line (e.g., +, +) and one mathematical operation (e.g. +) on the last line. First, participants must solve the first formula (5+7) using the first two numbers (5, 7) on the first line and the first mathematical operation (+) on the second line; then they must solve the second formula (7+2) using the last two numbers (7, 2) on the first line and the last mathematical operation (+) on the second line. Then, participants must solve the last formula using the answer of the first formula (12), the answer of the last formula (9), and the mathematical operation (+) on the last line. In this case, participants give the final answer (21). 8) In <italic>Time Lapse</italic>, two analog clocks are presented. Participants must calculate the difference in time between the two clocks. At the beginning of the game, participants can do only three training games (<italic>Calculation&#x000d7;20</italic>, <italic>Calculation&#x000d7;100</italic>, and <italic>Reading Aloud</italic>). New games are added to the game list after training for several days. After playing the games, the game performance at each game and the playing time of each game are recorded in the game memory (<italic>Brain Age</italic>).

Although the actual game scores were recorded in the game, to maintain motivation to participate in this study, we asked participants to write down the game performance data. After the intervention period, we checked whether or not the scores which participants reported matched the actual scores which were recorded in the video game. Although most scores which participants reported were consistent with the actual scores, we used the actual game scores from the game for our analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>Active control group (Tetris)</title><p>We used <italic>Tetris</italic> (Nintendo Co.

After a complete line with no gaps is formed, the line disappears. If no lines are formed, then the blocks pile higher and higher until the block pile reaches the top of the screen, at which point the game ends and the player loses. The goal is to keep the game going as long as possible by forming complete lines with the descending blocks. As the game progresses, the blocks descend faster, giving players less time to choose where to place each block. After playing the game, the game performance (total score) is recorded in the video game (<italic>Tetris</italic>).

Consequently, any one digit would appear five times in each row with randomly determined neighbors. D-CAT consists of three such sheets. Participants were instructed to search for the target number(s) that had been specified to them and to delete each one with a slash mark as quickly and as accurately as possible until the experimenter sent a stop signal. Three trials were used, first with a single target number (6), second with two target numbers (9 and 4), and third with three (8, 3, and 7). Each trial was given 1 minute. Consequently, the total time required for D-CAT was 3 min. In the second and third trials, it was emphasized that all instructed target numbers should be cancelled without omission. The primary measure of this test is the number of hits (correct answers). We used only the number of hits in the first trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2e10"><title>SRT</title><p>Simple Reaction Time (SRT) evaluates attention <xref rid="pone.0055518-Sano1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In the SRT test, a single stimulus &#x0201c;X&#x0201d; appeared in the center of the screen. The participant was instructed to press the enter key with the right index finger as quickly as possible when the stimulus appeared. The stimulus reappeared with a random delay ranging from 250 ms to 2500 ms (250, 500, 750, 1000, 1250, 1500, 1750, 2000, 2250, and 2500). The test has 4 blocks of 50 trials. The total number of trials was 200 trials. The primary measure in this task is reaction time on the SRT. The reasons why we selected the SRT as an attentional measure are 1) previous study suggested the SRT can measure attention <xref rid="pone.0055518-Sano1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>

The Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of attentional measure was 0.67. A commonly accepted Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha is over 0.7, although a value of 0.6 can be accepted during exploratory research <xref rid="pone.0055518-HairJr1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Nunnally1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>.

The primary measure of this test is the number of correct answers.</p></sec><sec id="s2e12"><title>SS</title><p>Symbol search (SS) is a subtest of WAIS-III <xref rid="pone.0055518-Wechsler1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. This test measures processing speed. The SS contains 60 items. For this subtest, the participants visually scan two groups of symbols (a target group and a search group) and indicate if either of the target symbols matches any of the symbols in the search group. The participants respond to as many items as possible within a 120 s time limit. The primary measure of this test is the number of correct answers.</p></sec><sec id="s2e13"><title>MR</title><p>Mental rotation (MR) measures visuo-spatial ability <xref rid="pone.0055518-Shepard1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Participants try to determine whether two simultaneously presented shapes are the same or different. They responded as quickly and as accurately as possible by pressing one of two keys. The shape on the right was either the same shape or a mirror image of the shape on the left, and the two shapes differed in orientation by 0&#x000b0;, 45&#x000b0;, 90&#x000b0;, 135&#x000b0;, 180&#x000b0;, 225&#x000b0;, 270&#x000b0;, or 315&#x000b0;. All other shapes can appear equally often at each rotation from 0&#x000b0; to 315&#x000b0;. Participants completed 10 practice trials followed by 128 test trials. The primary measure in this task is the average reaction time in each rotation from 0&#x000b0; to 315&#x000b0; on the mental rotation task.

JART is a Japanese version of the National Adult Reading Test (NART), which has a reading test of 50 irregularly spelled words in English (e.g. ache). JART is a reading test consisting of 25 Kanji compound words (e.g., ??, ??). The reading stimuli were printed out randomly for reading. The subjects were asked to read each Kanji compound word aloud. This task assesses reading ability and IQ. The primary measure for this task is the number of correct items.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Questionnaires of Subjective Feeling for the Intervention</title><p>Previous study suggested that differences of subject feeling (e.g. motivation, fatigue, satisfactions) between intervention groups may affect improvement of cognitive functions <xref rid="pone.0055518-Green2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.

First, the permutation test is a suitable for small sample analysis and is distribution free <xref rid="pone.0055518-May1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Ludbrook1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-KheradPajouh1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>.

There are some methods (e.g. multiple testing corrections and re-sampling) to control Type 1 error. Bonferroni <xref rid="pone.0055518-Hsu1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref> and Benjamini and Hochberg (False discovery rate; FDR) <xref rid="pone.0055518-Benjamini1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref> correction methods are typical multiple testing correction methods. Permutation test is a typical resampling method <xref rid="pone.0055518-Belmonte1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. The Bonferroni correction is known to be extremely conservative. It can lead to Type II (i.e. false negative) errors of unacceptable levels, which may contribute to publication bias and the exclusion of potentially relevant hypotheses <xref rid="pone.0055518-Nakagawa1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. In contrast, FDR method is less stringent, which may lead to the selection of more false positives. Thus, permutation tests have become widely accepted and recommended in studies that involved multiple statistical testing <xref rid="pone.0055518-Shuster1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Anyela1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Nakagawa1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>.</p><p>Moreover, we report eta square (<italic>&#x003b7;<sup>2</sup></italic>) as an index of effect size.

The near transfer effect refers to improvements in cognitive domains that are closely related to the trained cognitive processes. In contrast, the far transfer effect refers to improvements in cognitive domain that are not closely related to the trained cognitive processes. From the viewpoints of the near and far transfer effects, the cognitive measures in this study are divisible into two measures of the transfer effects (near and far). For the <italic>Brain Age</italic> playing group, executive functions, working memory, and processing speed were the measures of the near transfer effect. The others were measures of the far transfer effects. The reason is that the training domains of <italic>Brain Age</italic> would be expected to train executive functions, working memory, and processing speed. For the <italic>Tetris</italic> playing group, attention and visuo-spatial ability were the measures of the near transfer effect; the others were the measures of the far transfer effects because the training of <italic>Tetris</italic> would be expected to train attention and visuo-spatial ability. Our results show that playing <italic>Brain Age</italic> and <italic>Tetris</italic> had only the near transfer effects, but not the far transfer effects. Some explanations might be applicable for the absence of the far transfer effect in this study. First, the possibility exists that the training term of our study (4 weeks) is not a sufficient time to obtain the far transfer effect. Second, our video game training was not intended for use as an adaptive training method. Results of previous studies suggest that the adaptive training method is more effective for improvement of cognitive functions than a non-adaptive training program <xref rid="pone.0055518-Takeuchi2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Klingberg1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. Because <italic>Brain Age</italic> and <italic>Tetris</italic> did not change the difficulty of tasks depending on the participant&#x02019;s performance, we were unable to identify the far transfer effect.</p><p>The mechanism of the near transfer effects through playing <italic>Brain Age</italic> can be explained using a recent hypothesis, which proposes that the transfer effect can be induced if the processes during both training and transfer tasks are overlapped and are involved in similar brain regions <xref rid="pone.0055518-Nouchi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Dahlin1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Most training games in <italic>Brain Age</italic> entail an element of the calculations and readings <xref rid="pone.0055518-Nouchi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. To perform these processes, the prefrontal regions <xref rid="pone.0055518-Kawashima2" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Miura1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> or the precuneus <xref rid="pone.0055518-Arsalidou1" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Graves1" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref> should be recruited. The executive functions, working memory, and processing speed, which showed a significant transfer effect by the brain training game in this study, also involve the prefrontal cortex <xref rid="pone.0055518-Carpenter2" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Kane1" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Kennedy1" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref> and the precuneus <xref rid="pone.0055518-Banich1" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Cavanna1" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Genova1" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Takeuchi3" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Usui2" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>. These findings suggest that both training games and transfer tasks can share the same brain region, the prefrontal cortex or the precuneus, and that the near transfer effects of the brain training game on the executive functions, working memory, and processing speed can be mediated by the prefrontal regions or the precuneus. Further studies will be necessary to test this hypothesis using neuroimaging techniques (e.g. magnetic resonance imaging; MRI or magnetoencephalography; MEG). Brain activations or brain structures (e.g. gray matter volume or white matter integrity) in these regions may be changed after playing video games.</p><p>To test the overlapped hypothesis using the data of the present study, we conducted Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation analyses between a change score of training games in <italic>Brain Age</italic> (a last game score minus a first game score) and the change score of cognitive functions. The analyses showed that 1) the change score of <italic>Calculation&#x000d7;20</italic> significantly correlated with the change score of Ari (<italic>Spearman's &#x003c1;</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.54, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;.05) and that of ST (<italic>Spearman's &#x003c1;</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.51, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;.05), 2) the change score of <italic>Calculation&#x000d7;100</italic> significantly correlated with the change score of ST (<italic>Spearman's &#x003c1;</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.56, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;.05), and 3) <italic>Reading aloud</italic> significantly correlated with the change score of Ari (<italic>Spearman's &#x003c1;</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.66, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;.05). There were not significant correlations between the change score of other training games and the change score of cognitive functions. These results partially support the overlapped hypothesis. The reason of lacks of the correlation may be because of the number of participants (<italic>N</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;16) is apparently not suitable to identify the relationships between the change score of other training games and the change score of cognitive functions. To confirm the overlapped hypothesis, further studies using a larger sample size should be needed.</p><p>The current study presents several strengths compared with earlier studies <xref rid="pone.0055518-Nouchi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-McDougall1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Miller2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Owen1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Jaeggi1" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref> that have investigated the beneficial effects of brain training games on cognitive functions. First, unlike previous studies <xref rid="pone.0055518-McDougall1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Jaeggi1" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>, we used a randomized controlled trial with an active control group (<italic>Tetris</italic> group). The randomized controlled trial is an excellent means to provide effectiveness of cognitive training. Using the active control group is expected to control for test&#x02013;retest effects and positive effects to play some video games. Therefore, our study can provide sufficient scientific evidence of the beneficial effects of the commercial brain training games on cognitive functions. Secondly, in contrast to many other studies <xref rid="pone.0055518-Nouchi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-McDougall1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Miller2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Owen1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Jaeggi1" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>, we measured widely various cognitive functions. Therefore, results show that the brain training game had the near transfer effect, but not the far transfer effect.</p><p>It is important to consider why the previous study <xref rid="pone.0055518-Ackerman1" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref> could not show the improvement of cognitive functions after playing other types of brain training game for 20 hours. There were some disadvantages in the previous study <xref rid="pone.0055518-Ackerman1" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>. First, the previous study used Big Brain Academy as the brain training game. Unlike in the case of <italic>Brain Age</italic>, the video game did not base on the scientific evidences. Secondly, the previous study used a within-participants (crossover) procedure, where each participant took part in both the brain training session and the reading articles session (control condition). Although this crossover design can reduce individual differences and sample size, the design has some limitations. The most significant problem of the crossover design is the &#x02018;carryover&#x02019; effect. The carryover effect is defined as the persistence (whether physically or in terms of effect) of treatment (intervention) applied in one treatment phase of the study to subsequent treatment (intervention) phases. Thirdly, the previous study reported that most of the participants were not excited about playing Big Brain Academy after the study <xref rid="pone.0055518-Ackerman1" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>. On the other hand, our participants felt satisfaction and enjoyment for playing <italic>Brain Age</italic>. Because of these disadvantages, the previous study <xref rid="pone.0055518-Ackerman1" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref> did not find the improvement of cognitive functions after playing Big Brain Academy for 20 hours.</p><p>It is essential to discuss the similar and the different results between the previous study using <italic>Brain Age</italic> and <italic>Tetris</italic> in the older adults <xref rid="pone.0055518-Nouchi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and the present study in the younger adults. The similar result was that <italic>Brain Age</italic> improved the executive functions and processing speed in both the younger adults and the older adults. These results would prove the efficacy of playing <italic>Brain Age</italic> on cognitive functions for the healthy adults regardless of age. The different result was that the present results in the young adults showed the improvements of working memory after playing <italic>Brain Age</italic> and the improvements of visuo-spatial ability and attention which was measured SRT after playing <italic>Tetris</italic>. Previous study <xref rid="pone.0055518-Nouchi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> did not measure working memory, visuo-spatial ability and attention using SRT. Thus, it is not clear yet that <italic>Brain Age</italic> can improve working memory in the older adults and <italic>Tetris</italic> can improve visuo-spatial and attention measured SRT in the older adults. Additional research should be needed to investigate using the same cognitive measures.</p><p>It is also important to consider the limitations of this study. First, we did not assess the long-term benefit of playing the brain training game. Some previous studies showed that cognitive training had a long-term benefit on cognitive functions <xref rid="pone.0055518-Jaeggi1" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Willis1" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref>. One important future direction is to examine whether or not the brain training game can be expected to have long-term beneficial effects on cognitive functions. Second, the brain training game (<italic>Brain Age</italic>) consisted of multiple training games (see the Methods section). Multiple training programs can demonstrate intense transfer effects <xref rid="pone.0055518-Green2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Goldstone1" ref-type="bibr">[92]</xref>. However, it would be difficult to identify the beneficial effects of each training program on cognitive functions <xref rid="pone.0055518-Takeuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Third, we did not use the multiple cognitive measures for the visuo-spatial ability. Previous studies <xref rid="pone.0055518-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Sims1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> demonstrated the relationships between experiences of playing video games and the visuo-spatial ability. Because we use only the mental rotation task as the visuo-spatial ability, it is still unclear about the beneficial effects of the brain training game on the other types of visuo-spatial ability. It would be importance to consider whether or not the brain training game can improve a wide range of visuo-spatial ability. Fourth, we measured the subject feelings (motivation, fatigue, satisfactions) only once (after intervention). The subject feeling would change (increase or decrease) during the intervention period. To investigate the influence of the subjective feeling on improvements of the cognitive functions in more detail, further study which will measure the subjective feelings several times during an intervention period will be necessary. Fifth, there is a possibility that a difference between types of video game would affect the improvements of the cognitive functions. For example, <italic>Brain Age</italic> can act as a kind of a virtual coach who encourages systematically the participants to improve their performances. On the other hand, <italic>Tetris</italic> did not systematically facilitate the improvement of the performance. In the present study, the motivation and the satisfaction after playing video games did not differ between <italic>Brain Age</italic> and <italic>Tetris</italic>. However, the difference of types of video games may influence the improvement of the cognitive functions. A future study would be needed to investigate the effect of the virtual coach of brain training games on the cognitive functions.</p><p>To conclude, this study produced scientific evidence demonstrating that the commercial brain training game had beneficial effects on cognitive functions (executive functions, working memory, and processing speed) in healthy young adults. Our previous study, which used the same intervention method, also demonstrated that playing the brain training game improved executive functions and processing speed in healthy elderly people <xref rid="pone.0055518-Nouchi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Results of the present and previous studies demonstrate that the commercial brain training game can at least improve executive functions and processing speed in healthy young people and healthy older adults. Our results do not indicate that everyone should play brain training games because 1) we did not compare the beneficial effects of brain training games to the beneficial effect of other effective training methods (e.g., fitness training or working memory training) <xref rid="pone.0055518-Takeuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Hillman1" ref-type="bibr">[93]</xref>, 2) the brain training game had only the near transfer effect on cognitive functions <xref rid="pone.0055518-Nouchi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, and 3) some limitations are applicable, as discussed above. However, the commercial brain training game might be a simple and convenient means to improve some cognitive functions. We believe that our findings are highly relevant to applications in educational and clinical fields. Some reports of previous studies have described that that the brain training game can support classroom activities for children <xref rid="pone.0055518-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-Miller2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and that they can improve cognitive functions (e.g. executive functions) for older adults <xref rid="pone.0055518-Nouchi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055518-McDougall1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. One important future direction is to examine whether or not the brain training game can support educational and clinical activities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0055518.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
