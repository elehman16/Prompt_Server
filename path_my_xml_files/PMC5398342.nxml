These interventions alter the way choices are presented, and/or the properties or placement of objects or stimuli within a micro-environment in an attempt to prompt healthier behaviours. Interventions of this type do not coerce or prohibit any action on the part of the individual (see <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Ref. 11</xref> for an operational definition). By altering the environments within which people make choices, choice architecture interventions allow behaviour to be influenced at the population level.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The advantages of these interventions are that they mainly rely on automatic psychological processes,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> resulting in an impact regardless of individual differences. Choice architecture interventions which can be embedded within micro-environments where alcohol consumption occurs (e.g. public houses and home environments) are likely to be particularly effective, given the wide potential reach of such interventions.</p><p id="P7">Glassware is one potential target for choice architecture interventions. It has been shown that the shape of glassware affects how individuals interact with it. For example, when asked to pour a standard measure, students and bartenders poured more alcohol into short, wide glasses than tall, slender glasses.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> A mechanism to explain this difference is that individuals tend to focus their attention on the height the liquid reaches and insufficiently compensate for the width of the glass.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> People also tend to estimate that tall, slender glasses hold more liquid than wide glasses of the same volume.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> This may increase actual consumption volume while reducing perceived consumption volume.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In support, a study investigating the effect of glass shape on drinking rate<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> reported that beer (but not lemonade) was consumed slower from a straight glass compared with a curved glass. In addition, participants judged glass midpoint in a separate computerised task, and there was evidence of a positive relationship between degree of error and total drinking time. This suggests that inaccuracies in volume judgements may be greater when changes in height and volume of liquid are not directly proportional, which may lead to faster drinking speed and/or greater overall intake. Therefore, providing volume information on glassware may mitigate this effect by rectifying these perceptual errors. Providing visual cues to inform consumptive behaviour has shown promise in other areas; food researchers have shown that plates containing portion size information induce greater weight loss in obese patients compared with plates without portion size information.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p id="P8">Drinkers appear to self-titrate their alcohol intake under <italic>ad libitum</italic> conditions, albeit imperfectly, to achieve similar blood alcohol levels when consuming drinks of differing strengths.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Under laboratory conditions, there is evidence that drinkers alter their drinking rate when consuming lagers of different alcohol-by-volume profiles.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Therefore, it would seem important to evaluate the effect of volume information on lagers of different strength.</p><p id="P9">We investigated whether volume information on curved glasses alters the time taken to consume an alcoholic beverage. In addition, in Study 1 we investigated dose effects by including a lager strength factor. We hypothesised that curved glasses with volume information would result in longer drinking times compared with curved glasses with no volume information. We also hypothesised that glass markings would slow drinking times more for standard strength lager compared with low strength lager.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Study 1</title><sec sec-type="methods" id="S7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Design and overview</title><p id="P10">The study used a 2 &#x000d7; 2 design with glass marking (unmarked, marked) and lager strength (low, standard) as predictor variables. In order to maintain equal numbers of participants in each condition, we randomly assigned 50% of participant numbers to the markings condition and 50% to the no markings condition. This ensured that overall there were equal numbers of participants in both conditions. We did this separately for male and female participants to ensure an equal sex ratio across groups. Group allocation was randomised via randomisation software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.randomizer.org">https://www.randomizer.org</ext-link>). Data were captured by video recording and the primary outcome measure was total drinking time. Subjective measures of alcohol craving and mood were taken to assess any changes during the study session. Ethics approval was obtained from the Faculty of Science Research Ethics Committee at the University of Bristol (reference: 310108288). The study was conducted according to the revised Declaration of Helsinki (2000) and Good Clinical Practice guidelines (fifth revision). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects" id="S9"><title>Participants</title><p id="P11">Social alcohol drinkers, aged between 18 and 40 years and who reported consuming between 10 and 50 units/week if male, or between 5 and 35 units/week if female, were recruited from the staff and students of the University of Bristol, and from the general population by means of poster and flyer advertisements, existing participant database and word-of-mouth. Exclusion criteria included current use of illicit substances (excluding cannabis), current use of psychiatric medication, a strong family history of alcoholism (defined as at least one first-degree relative or two or more second-degree relatives) and not drinking/liking lager. Eligibility was ascertained by self-report. Participants were asked to abstain from alcohol consumption for 12 h prior to the test session, and were only enrolled onto the study if they provided a 0 &#x003bc;g/100 ml breath alcohol reading. Participants were reimbursed &#x000a3;7 or awarded course credit, as appropriate, at the end of the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials" id="S10"><title>Materials</title><p id="P12">Alcoholic beverages used were low strength (Bi&#x000e8;re des Moulins&#x02122;, 3.8% ABV) and standard strength (St. Cervois&#x02122;, 4.8% ABV) lagers.

Upon arrival, participants were given an opportunity to read the information sheet and ask questions before providing written informed consent. Participants were told that the study examined the effects of alcohol consumption on word search performance, in order to disguise the primary outcome measure. Participants were screened to ensure that they met the inclusion criteria, and breath alcohol was measured.</p><p id="P15">In the main session, participants received 12 fl oz (i.e. a full glass) of lager (either low or standard strength in an unmarked or marked glass as per randomisation). Drinks were chilled prior to serving and were poured immediately prior to consumption in order to ensure that carbonation was consistent across participants. Self-report measures of alcohol use (AUDIT), alcohol craving (AUQ, VAS) and mood (VASs) were obtained. Participants were told that they should consume all of the drink at their own pace whilst watching a nature documentary (Earth: The Journey of a Lifetime, BBC Worldwide 2008). The experimenter started the film (at the same point for all participants) and left the room. The drinking session was recorded using a video camera (Hitachi Hybrid Camcorder DZHS500E). Participants opened the door when they had finished their beverage, the experimenter returned and presented participants with a word-search task in which they were instructed to find as many words as possible in 4 min. This was intended to disguise the nature of the study, and these data were not analysed. Then, measures of alcohol craving (AUQ, VAS) and mood (VASs) were administered again. Finally, participants were informed that debriefing information would follow via email at the end of the study, and were reimbursed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P16">The video recordings were viewed by one researcher, and total drink time (i.e. time from initiation of first sip to end of last sip) was extracted.

Total drinking time outliers were identified using boxplots, and defined as 1.5 times the interquartile range above quartile 3 or below quartile 1.

However, these results should be interpreted with caution as the confidence intervals around the estimated mean differences were wide and were also consistent with faster consumption from marked glasses. It should also be noted that removing outliers increased the mean difference in drinking times in Study 2. Together, findings from both studies provide tentative support for the hypothesis that volume information results in slower consumption of an alcoholic beverage.</p><p id="P32">One possible explanation for this effect is that individuals use volume perceptions to titrate their drinking rate of an alcoholic beverage, in order to control level of intoxication. Longer intervals between sips in the marked glass group in Study 2 would support this interpretation. It may be the case that providing volume information assists a drinker to more accurately gauge how much they have consumed, as perceived consumption reportedly affects subsequent behaviour.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Explicit quantitative information, as used in Study 2, appears to have assisted drinkers to more effectively slow their drinking times compared with the marking used in Study 1.</p><p id="P33">These results have policy implications if the effects seen are replicated in larger studies. In the UK, the 2003 Licensing Act<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> afforded powers to local licensing authorities to issue alcohol licences and enforce the conditions of the licence in their area. A local licensing authority would be able to add a requirement to stock glasses with volume information to its &#x02018;menu&#x02019; of licensing conditions, which premises must accept in order to be granted a license or have a license renewed. Future studies should investigate applying volume markings to glassware in naturalistic settings (e.g. bars).</p><p id="P34">There are limitations to these studies that should be considered when interpreting the results. First, while we observed slower drinking times in marked glasses, it is unclear whether this would translate to reduced intake overall, as unit bias<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and personal consumption norms<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> need to be overcome to reduce overall intake. To address this limitation, future studies should focus on comparing within-subject <italic>ad libitum</italic> consumption of multiple alcoholic drinks from marked and unmarked glasses across multiple sessions to determine whether overall intake can be reduced. Second, the volume marking in Study 1 may have failed to inform drinkers that it constituted the volume midpoint of the glass due to no explicit information denoting that fact communicated to participants; however, this was addressed in Study 2. Third, participants may have been unable to detect the difference (1% ABV) in the strength of the lagers in Study 1. Fourth, the differences observed within and between both studies could be explained by demand characteristics rather than experimental manipulation. Markings in the intervention conditions may have primed awareness in participants that their drinking behaviour was being monitored and this resulted in slower drinking times. Recent findings<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> from a review on eating behaviour would support this interpretation, although the evidence is mixed for drinking behaviour.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Fifth, both studies lacked statistical power to detect small effects that might still be relevant at a population level. Sixth, our sample comprised predominantly of undergraduate students and findings may not generalise to other consumer groups with different patterns of drinking.</p><p id="P35">In conclusion, our data provide tentative support that volume information may influence the rate of consumption of alcoholic beverages, but this may depend on the design and content of the information. An effect of glass markings could be due to volume information enabling more accurate volume judgements, which in turn could lead to slower consumption. Although our findings are ambiguous, there is sufficient evidence to warrant a larger study in the future. Further research is also needed to examine the mechanisms underlying the effects observed. If glass marking can be shown to influence rate of alcohol consumption, this has the potential to be implemented as one of a suite of viable choice architecture interventions in drinking environments in order to slow consumption rates and reduce alcohol-related harms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary data</title><p id="P36"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article-abstract/doi/10.1093/eurpub/ckw142/2433500/Effect-of-glass-markings-on-drinking-rate-in?redirectedFrom=fulltext">Supplementary data</ext-link> are available at <italic>EURPUB</italic> online.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS71084-supplement-Supplementary_Data.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e501" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S23"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The contributions of Gavin Holmes in collecting data in Study 1 and Ellen Coughlan who rated topography measures in Study 2 are gratefully acknowledged.
