Though there were no long-term neural injury in that study the block quality degraded and the reasons were attributed to use of wider gauge Tuohy needle. There is no clear consensus regarding optimal configuration of needle required with regard to its caliber, type for SCB and its clinical implication postoperatively.</p><p>In the present study, we hypothesized that reducing Tuohy needle caliber to 20-gauge for SCB could be beneficial in improving block quality while simultaneously retaining the advantage of atraumatic blunt tip. Hence, the present study was aimed to evaluate and compare time to establishment of sensory and motor SCB with 20-gauge blunt versus short bevel needle under USG for patients undergoing upper limb surgeries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We undertook this prospective, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the onset time of sensory and motor block of individual nerves in SCB under USG. The study was conceived in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments. The study protocol was approved by the Hospital Institutional Ethics Committee (GMC/TA-I (19)/2011/20317) and registered with Clinical Trials Registry India (CTRI/2011/07/001876). Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects recruited during June 2011 to March 2015. The design and conduct of the trial adhered to the CONSORT statement. Inclusion criteria were patients of ASA physical status 1-2, aged between 18 and 60 years scheduled for upper limb surgeries. Exclusion criteria was patients with neuropathy involving the arm undergoing surgery, mental incapacity, body mass index &#x0003e;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, known allergy to local anesthetics, local infection, coagulopathy, and any other contraindication to peripheral nerve blocks.</p><p>The patients were evaluated a day prior to surgery, and all routine and required investigations were done. All patients fasted for 8 h prior to surgery and were premedicated with pantaprazole 40 mg and alprazolam 0.25 mg per oral at night and 2 h prior to surgery. On arrival of patient in the operating room intravenous (IV) access was secured and standard anesthesia monitoring (Aestiva 5&#x02122; 7900, GE healthcare, Datex-Ohmeda division, Helsinki, Finland) including noninvasive blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation and electrocardiographic monitoring were started and recorded every 5 min.</p><p>The patients were placed in supine position with the head turned 45&#x000b0; to opposite side of the surgery. A single operator anesthesiologist (VA) experienced in ultrasound performed all the SCBs. Under strict asepsis, the supraclavicular area of the side to be operated was cleaned and draped. The ultrasound probe (8-15 MHz Sono Site<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Titan, Washington, USA) was placed in coronal oblique plane in supraclavicular fossa to visualize subclavian artery and brachial plexus. The brachial plexus appeared as a cluster of hyperechoic nodules usually found lateral to the round pulsating subclavian artery lying on the top of the hyperechoic first rib.</p><p>Allocation concealment was done with opaque sealed envelopes. Patients were randomized using computer-generated random number table, and the envelope was opened immediately before block placement by an anesthesiologist who was not involved in the study and assessment of patients. The patient and the assessor were blinded to the group allocation. Local anesthesia with 2 ml of 2% lignocaine was given subcutaneously in all the patients for insertion of block needle. The patients received SCB under USG with needle using in plane technique (to facilitate visualization of spread of local anesthetic and direction of block needle in real time and at the same time avoiding inadvertent vessel and pleural injury) as per group allocation to either of the two groups.</p><p>Blunt bevel needle group (<italic>n</italic> = 30): SCB under USG using 20-gauge Tuohy needle (BD Medical, 1 Becton Drive, Franklin Lakes, NJ 07417, USA).</p><p>Short bevel needle group (<italic>n</italic> = 30): SCB under USG using short bevel needle 20-gauge (150 mm) insulated needle with extension set (B. Braun Medical Inc., Bethlehem, PA, USA).</p><p>Ultrasound probe was placed inside a sterile cover, and needle movement was observed in the real-time. The tip of the needle was positioned at the junction of first rib and artery under USG and normal saline 2 ml was injected to confirm the spread around the plexus. In an event of any paresthesias, the needle was repositioned, and care was taken to avoid intraneural injection. If the local anesthetic spread did not reach some parts of brachial plexus, the needle was repositioned. A mixture of local anesthetic (1: 2 mixture of lignocaine 2% with 1:200,000 adrenaline and bupivacaine 0.5%) at a dose 0.5 ml/kg up to a maximum of 40 ml was given in increments of 3-5 ml every minute carefully after negative aspiration. The maximum dose of lignocaine with adrenaline was 7 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg for bupivacaine.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>

Hence, 60 patients were randomized to either of the two groups, and all the patients completed the study [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The patient and clinical characteristics for each group showed no significant difference between the groups as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. The surgeries performed under SCB were similar in both the groups. The needle time was shorter in short bevel group due to superior visualization as compared to blunt bevel needle under USG, but the performance time was similar in both the groups as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>. The time to establishment of sensory block and motor block in individual nerve territory was similar in both the groups as shown in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>.

According to literature, the choice of needle has an important role in onset of sensory-motor block and intraneural peripheral nerve injuries.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Long-bevel needles were known to produce more fascicular injuries as they probably impaled the nerves.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] We used 20-gauge short bevel versus blunt bevel needles and did not include long-bevel needle as comparator group as it would have been unethical due to evidence of harm described in the literature.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The nerve trauma has a direct relation on the diameter of the needle used in the &#x0201c;intentional nerve&#x0201d; injury.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The rational given by Fredrickson <italic>et al</italic>. of using an 18-gauge needle in their study was, that use of a larger diameter needle would avoid penetration of the needle into the peineural neurovascular sheath when performed under USG. The literature reports no evidence of intraneural injection with an 18-gauge needle.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Combining the evidences from these studies we kept our needle choice as a 20-gauge short bevel needle to overcome the failure rate as evidenced by use of 18-gauge Tuohy's needle and also to avoid any inadvertent intraneural injection which may occur by a fine bore needle long-bevel needle. Fredrickson <italic>et al</italic>. reported lower success rate of 57% SCB and the possible causes attributed to it were reduced local anesthetic volume (25-30 ml), large caliber needle and more likely nonutilization of neuro stimulation. A significant neurological nerve injury was observed in one patient in supraclavicular group, but the patient did not require any electrophysiological evaluation.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In the present study, the higher surgical success rate was attributed to correct placement of tip of the needle confirmed on USG as uniform spread of local anesthetic that bathed the brachial plexus. The mean local anesthetic volume used in the present study was 35 ml (0.5 ml/kg) which was slightly higher than the earlier study[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] but does not seem to be the only cause of higher success of surgical block in our study. The literature suggests that time, quality and duration of block was not be improved only by arbitrarily increasing drug mass or its determinants, volume and concentration.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Higher neurological complications occur in proximal brachial plexus block due to direct nerve trauma (1-6%)[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and reduced nonneural tissue.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Block placement under USG with a smaller gauge blunt tip block needle can still result in an unintentional intraneural injection occurred in 17% of patients. Intraneural placement on USG is shown as an increase in nerve area &#x0003e;15%, echo-lucent areas within the nerve and visualization of the needle tip indentating and penetrating the nerve wall.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Neurological dysfunction is influenced with factors, such as obesity, neurologic and metabolic diseases, neurotoxicity, mechanical and ischemic injury, may contribute to the development of acute and/or chronic nerve damage. These patients were not enrolled in the present study. Elicitation of paresthesia during regional techniques is not linked to anesthesia related nerve injury but rather it is the pain on injection that is more consistently linked to injury.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Patients were asked to report painful injections suggestive of intrafascicular injection and injury that would prompt repositioning of the needle. However, we did not use any device for pressure measurement to detect high intraneural injection pressure and relied on the pressure by the syringe's feel, which can be at times variable.</p><p>Surprisingly, one patient in the present study had complete motor block but reported partial sensory block in the medial cutaneous nerve of arm and required GA. Partial or no nerve block was observed in (2/30 patients) in ulnar and (4/30 patients) in median nerve territories in blunt bevel needle in the present study. In an earlier study ulnar (11/30 patients) and median (4/30 patients) nerves had partial or no block with 18-gauge Touhy needle for placement of SCB. This probably occurred due to corner pocket technique used by the authors.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The sparing of ulnar and median nerves usually occurs due to nonplacement of needle tip near the lower trunk that is close to first rib due to risk of pneumothorax. An earlier study showed superior results with stimulation of lower trunk of SCB.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>The limitation of the study was nonutilization of pressure manometer during injection of local anesthetics and patients were followed only till 10 days postoperatively. Further multicenter trials are required to validate the results of this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The time to establishment of sensory and
