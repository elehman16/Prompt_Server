A vicious cycle exists between depression and these chronic diseases, with each being a risk factor for the other.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> Higher mortality has been demonstrated for people with depression and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) or coronary heart disease (CHD) beyond that due to the separate diseases alone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> For patients with depression and T2DM or CHD or both, there are increased risks of adverse outcomes,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> but this comorbid depression is often missed in primary care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> Consequently, the identification of depression has now been incorporated into many heart disease guidelines as one of the requirements for optimal management. Meeting these challenges will require an innovative use of the existing general practice workforce, and such a reorientation of resources has been identified as one of the grand challenges.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></p><p>Collaborative care is a system that has been shown to be more effective for chronic disease management than standard care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> It includes a reorientation of the medical workforce through new or adjusted roles for team members, particularly using practice nurses (PNs) as the identified case manager to undertake the care of the patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> It also includes the use of evidence-based guidelines, systematic screening and monitoring of risk factors, timetabled recall visits, information support for the clinician, enhanced patient self-management, a means of effective communication between all members of the care team and audit information for the practice. Since self-care for diabetes has been found to be suboptimal across a range of self-managed activities, particularly for patients with depression, a collaborative care model may be able to achieve better quality of care through the case manager monitoring patient progress.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></p><p>Evaluation of a change in the way general practice clinics look after patients requires complex intervention methodology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> beyond single interventions such as the introduction of a guideline with financial incentives.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> This methodology began with a search for potential models of care (step I), and led to adopting the University of Washington's successful IMPACT model of Collaborative Care for depression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> In the exploratory trial (step II), our pilot project<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> adapted IMPACT by training PNs as case managers. PNs were trained to screen for depression using a patient self-report measure, the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> as part of comprehensive chronic disease management. They were also trained to use a protocol for care management based on the depression scores. The depression screening and management were embedded in routine visits for patients with diabetes or CHD. The pilot demonstrated that it was feasible to detect, monitor and treat depression in routine general practice alongside the usual biophysical measures, and identified moderate-to-severe depression in 34% of participants. The TrueBlue study was a randomised cluster trial (step III) that built on and extended the pilot. It investigated whether a collaborative care model (the intervention) is better than usual care (the control) for the management of patients with depression and T2DM, CHD or both in Australian general practice. It was designed to fit into normal clinic operations, making use of practice nurses and medical software, and was able to be funded by existing Australian Medicare rebates.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>The design and methodology of the study have been described in detail elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> The study started in 2009 and was undertaken in two phases. The first phase was a cluster randomised intervention trial in which general practices were randomly allocated to either an intervention group, in which nurse-led collaborative care was undertaken, or to a wait-list control group in which usual care led by the general practitioner (GP) was continued. At 6&#x02005;months, the TrueBlue training was provided to the control practices. The key aims of the first phase were to determine whether participants with moderate-to-severe depression in the intervention group showed at least a five-point reduction from the baseline depression scores after 6&#x02005;months of intervention and whether this reduction was significantly better than in the control group. A five-point reduction reflects a clinically relevant change in individuals receiving depression treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> The secondary outcome was to determine whether the intervention also led to improvements in the patients&#x02019; physiological measures. The second phase followed the intervention group for an additional 6&#x02005;months to determine how the collaborative care model affected health outcomes over a 12-month period.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size calculation was based on detecting a 50% reduction in depression score at the 0.05 significance level with 80% power and a two-tailed test. Detecting a 50% reduction is more stringent than detecting a five-point reduction and provided some additional buffering. Using depression scores from an earlier study (a mean of 5.5 and an SD of 6.1),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> the calculation indicated that 237 patients would be required in each group. An intracluster correlation of 0.04 was used (SK Lo, personal communication), with a recruitment target of 50 patients per clinic. (Fifty patients were chosen so that clinics could budget for a nurse's time to carry out the intervention with four patients each week over the 3-month cycle of care.) To allow for difficulties in recruitment, a 50% dropout was used. On the basis of these, the study required 450 patients from nine clinics in the intervention group and the same in the control group.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Practice recruitment</title><p>Practices were identified in city and country areas on the basis of having a PN to provide the collaborative care and being able to identify eligible patients, those with CHD or T2DM or both, from their registries; these were invited to participate in the study until the 18 clinics required by the sample-size calculation were recruited. They were allocated by a random number generator to either the intervention or control arm of the study. The unit of randomisation was the clinic. Five practices (three country, two city) in the intervention group and six (two country, four city) in the control group completed the study. One country intervention clinic withdrew while the first-visit data were being collected when its TrueBlue-trained PN left the clinic, but some (n=13) patients from it did complete the study and data were collected from them. The study team was not able to determine why the other clinics withdrew.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Patient selection</title><p>Eligible patients were sent a postal survey that included a consent form which they were asked to complete and return with the enclosed PHQ-9 questionnaire, a self-report measure of depression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> The PHQ-9 has nine items, each scored from 0 (no problems) to 3 (problems nearly every day). The sum of the scores of the nine items will lie in one of five depression categories: none (0&#x02013;4), mild (5&#x02013;9), moderate (10&#x02013;14), moderately severe (15&#x02013;19) and severe (20&#x02013;27). (While it is known that responses to some of the PHQ-9 items may overlap with diabetes symptoms,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> our pilot demonstrated that nurses and patients preferred using the PHQ-9 because the patient's response to each of its items became the basis for the problem-solving and goal-setting activities that were part of TrueBlue.) Patients with scores of 5 or above, indicating some form of depression, were invited to participate in the study. A maximum of 50 patients per practice were invited. Patients in residential care or under 18&#x02005;years of age were not eligible. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012002171F1">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref> presents the CONSORT diagram of the patient-recruitment process.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2012002171F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow diagram of the recruitment process.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2012002171f01"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Patient safety</title><p>Participation in the intervention included a series of patient visits to their PN and usual GP every 3&#x02005;months over a 12-month period. Patients in the control group continued with their &#x02018;usual care&#x02019;. The control clinics were also provided with the PHQ-9 depression scores to ensure patient safety during the trial. The protocol required that PNs take action if severe depression was recorded in the returned PHQ-9 or if the patient had responded to the suicidal-ideation question (question 9) on the questionnaire. This action was to be taken <italic>irrespective of whether the clinic was in the intervention or the control group</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>PN training</title><p>The PN training included a 2-day workshop to prepare them for their enhanced roles in nurse-led collaborative care. Topics in the workshop included identifying and monitoring depression using the PHQ-9 questionnaire, and quality of life responses using V.2 of the SF36 questionnaire.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> Patient goal setting and problem solving were key components of the training with a particular emphasis on behavioural techniques to achieve improved mental health.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> The training also prepared the PNs for their role as case managers including ensuring that the Diabetes Australia and Australian National Heart Foundation guidelines were being followed and referrals were provided to appropriate services, such as allied health and mental health professionals, through discussion with the GPs.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Data collection</title><p>The research team developed a protocol-driven care-plan template from which study data could be extracted automatically and sent to the research team. The template was designed to be a multipurpose document in which the patient's medical history, current medications, allergies, biophysical and psychosocial measures, lifestyle risks, personal goals and referrals were recorded. It was designed to comply with the requirements to claim Australian Medicare rebates for care planning and to provide a checklist for &#x02018;gold-standard&#x02019; care. A copy of the care plan was provided to the patient as a written record of their progress.</p><p>The care-plan template collected physical measures, including body mass index, waist circumference, weight and blood pressure and the latest pathology results, including lipid profile, glycaemic control (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c) and renal function. Data also included lifestyle risk factors, such as smoking, alcohol consumption and level of physical activity, and depression score as measured by the PHQ-9 questionnaire. Referrals to and attendance at exercise programmes and with mental health workers were also recorded, along with the patient's own goals and possible barriers to achieving these goals. The care-plan template was used by the intervention-group clinics to acquire patient data at three monthly intervals over a 12-month period.</p><p>In the control group, the only complete dataset recorded using our comprehensive protocol-driven care-plan template was obtained after the 6&#x02005;months of &#x02018;usual care&#x02019; when the TrueBlue training was offered to the control clinics. No baseline or 3-month datasets were acquired since the study was deliberately designed to avoid changing the &#x02018;usual care&#x02019; that would have otherwise occurred by introducing our care-plan template. The study was designed in this way to be run pragmatically in the context of the clinics&#x02019; normal activities. The only baseline measure obtained was the depression score. On completion of the study, we retrospectively collected all the baseline data that the control clinics routinely recorded in their electronic medical records in order to have data for two time points, baseline and 6&#x02005;months.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Trueblue collaborative care</title><p>As part of the TrueBlue model, patients were scheduled to visit the practice every 3&#x02005;months for a 45&#x02005;min nurse consult followed by a 15&#x02005;min consult with their usual GP, in which stepped care (psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy) was offered if depression scores had not improved or had not dropped below a value of 5. The PN used the care-plan template and obtained current physical measures and reviewed recent pathology results. PNs also reviewed lifestyle risk factors. They readministered the PHQ-9 and worked with the patient to identify possible barriers to achieving their goals and discussed ways to overcome the barriers. This information gathering phase of the consultation was an opportunity to assist the patient with self-management by discussing the available educational resources, such as the library of fact sheets on aspects of self-management of depression, and setting personal goals for review at the next 3-monthly visit.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Participants in this study were clustered under clinics by design. It is known that clinics are likely to be different from each other and that ignoring the nested nature of the data may lead to biased estimates of parameter SEs. However, statistical techniques for correcting for the effects of clustering tend to be overly severe and conservative<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> when a small number of higher level units (clusters) are used, and therefore we tested whether the clinics were in fact significantly different from each other. Analysis of covariances (ANCOVAs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> were used to adjust for baseline values and to test the significance of changes in depression scores between clinics after 6&#x02005;months, using STATA V.11.1 for the statistical analyses.</p><p>Of the five clinics in the intervention (clinics 4, 5, 13, 15 and 17), only clinics 4 and 17 were significantly different from each other (F(1,76)=9.6, p&#x0003c;0.001). No other comparisons were significant between intervention clinics. Of the six clinics in the control group (clinics 1&#x02013;3, 6, 16 and 18), only clinics 6 and 18 were significantly different from each other (F(1,78)=14.5, p&#x0003c;0.001). No other comparisons were significant between control clinics. Furthermore, the intracorrelation coefficient of 0.058 for the primary outcome suggests that only 6% of the variance could be attributed to the clinic's level. Given this lack of difference between the clinics in each arm coupled with the sample-size requirements for reliable multilevel modelling,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> we analysed our data at the patient level.</p><p>In order to compare the effectiveness of the TrueBlue care model to the usual-care control, ANCOVAs were used to adjust for baseline values and test the significance of changes in continuous variables between the two groups after 6&#x02005;months. A multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression (STATA's xtmelogit) was used to test the significance of changes in the binary (categorical) variables between the two groups after 6&#x02005;months, with time and group as the independent variables and with random effects at the patient level. (We used the mixed-effects logistic-regression model since the pairs of observations over time are not independent, ie, observations at 6&#x02005;months would be expected to be related to the initial baseline observations.) Within each group, changes between the two time points (baseline and 6-month visits) were tested using paired t tests for the continuous variables and matched-case&#x02013;control McNemar &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests for the binary variables.</p><p>The longer-term effects of the intervention were evaluated over the 12-month period using multilevel mixed-effects linear regression (STATA's xtmixed) for the continuous variables and multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression (xtmelogit) for the binary variables. All the 3-monthly data available in the intervention group over the 12&#x02005;months were used. Note that the study design could not collect such &#x02018;usual care&#x02019; data from the control clinics since the data collection protocol was part of the intervention. In addition, TrueBlue training was provided to these clinics at 6&#x02005;months after which they ceased to be a control.</p><p>Patients from the clinics who withdrew before or during collection of first-visit data were excluded from the analyses. (Data for the 13 patients from one of these clinics who did complete the study have been included.) Characteristics from available clinics were compared between early dropouts and participating clinics and addressed in terms of their possible impact on the generalisability of the results. Missing 6-month data were replaced with their baseline values using the &#x02018;no change&#x02019; formulation of intention-to-treat by assuming that no change occurred between baseline and 6&#x02005;months. The underlying assumptions of the statistical tests used were assessed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Demographics)</title><p>A total of 5401 invitations (3104 interventions and 2297 controls; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012002171F1">figure 1</xref>) were posted to patients with either T2DM or CHD (or both) identified in the clinics&#x02019; registers. Approximately 30% (1057 interventions and 537 controls, including 39 additional patients invited in the waiting room) of the invitations were returned with completed constant forms and PHQ-9 questionnaires.

Patients experienced increased nurse contact time through the nurse consultations. They were provided with information about mental health and their physical health through psychoeducation resources and had their treatment intensified when required. Modalities included behavioural activation, antidepressant medication and referrals to mental health professionals and exercise programmes. Similar improvements in depression scores and stepped-up care were observed in the collaborative care model of Katon <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> The reduction in depression scores observed in the control group could be explained, in part, by control practices being provided with each patient's entry-level depression score during the recruitment process as part of the study's safety protocol. Usual care could have been influenced by drawing attention to comorbid depression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> as the protocol required that PNs take action if severe depression was recorded or if the patient had responded to the suicidal-ideation question. Referrals to mental-health workers by the control clinics had increased significantly, consistent with the clinics taking action where warranted. It is also known<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> that recruiting interested patients (those who wanted to participate) from interested clinics (those that agreed to join) can affect the representativeness of the study population. GPs with a particular interest in the study may be more likely to participate and manage their patients more effectively, irrespective of whether they are in the control or intervention arm. Consequently, a reduction in depression scores in the control group was expected, but the structured TrueBlue model did produce a significantly better reduction in depression. While the effect size may be small (Cohen's f=0.15), it is important to note that TrueBlue was designed to be implemented easily within general practices, with running costs funded by existing Australian Medicare rebates, and to make better use of their existing resources. These features mean that TrueBlue could be easily applied to patients across general practices at a population level, making the benefits clinically important.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Outcomes of phase 2</title><p>The key clinical outcomes over a 12-month period in the intervention group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012002171TB3">table 3</xref>) were a sustained improvement in mental health, demonstrated by symptom severity score (PHQ-9 total score) and by the patient's function and subjective evaluation of mental health (SF36 mental health composite score) and physical health (SF36 physical health composite score). Regular physical exercise has been shown to be important for reducing depression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> The self-reported exercise rates showed significant improvement over the 12&#x02005;months of collaborative care intervention. The biophysical measures reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012002171TB3">table 3</xref> showed modest improvements after 12&#x02005;months and the Framingham risk equations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> suggest a small but significant reduction in the 10-year CVD risk for the T2DM patients. These improvements were achieved despite the fact that we did not specifically select patients whose physiological parameters exceeded guidelines. Rather, our recruitment process was selected from the practice's disease registry on the basis of only the presence of depression and T2DM or CHD, and consequently, many patients were already being treated to target on measures such as cholesterol and HbA1c, leaving little room for improvement.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Limitations</title><p>We were able to run TrueBlue only in practices that used clinical software, which we used to generate a disease registry from which participants could be selected, and had a PN on staff. Clinics that chose to take part in the study may not have been representative of wider general practice. Operational limitations further reduced the number of practices over the duration of the study. Patient response rates to the mail-out (28%) may reflect anxiety over the new model of care where the patient discloses depression and visits the PN first rather than only the GP. Usual care in the control clinics may have been changed by patients completing the PHQ-9 and reading the project description. GPs were made aware of individual PHQ-9 results and took action where warranted. GP awareness of these biophysical and lifestyle risks may be expected to change clinical management. By design, TrueBlue practices needed to incorporate all research activities within the context of their busy clinics, and so only research data that could be extracted automatically were collected. The data dropout resulting from these two factors contributed to the observed small effect size. We were not able to obtain multiple data sets at three monthly intervals over 12&#x02005;months of &#x02018;usual care&#x02019; because the act of inviting patients and measuring depression scores and biophysical measures would in itself change the nature of usual care. In addition, practices would not have been willing to join the study if there was a chance of being randomly allocated to 12&#x02005;months of being in such a control arm.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Collaborative care</title><p>A recent UK study has shown the difficulties of disseminating a guideline without guidance on how to implement collaborative care.

Higher levels of adherence to guideline-recommended checks were also reported for TrueBlue. Patients and their carers, allied health professionals, specialists and GPs gained ready access to patient details provided in TrueBlue's care plan, enabling them to see at a glance where improved clinical care may be needed. The study achieved improved outcomes with the potential for prevention of heart attack and stroke through reduced 10-year CVD risk. The care plan template also allowed the practice to collect high quality audit data without taking up clinical time. While it was not possible to obtain complete financial data from the clinics specifically relating to the TrueBlue visits, the data that are available suggest that clinics did indeed cover their costs in implementing TrueBlue through Australian Medicare rebates. The success of TrueBlue and TeamCare<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> demonstrates that collaborative care is feasible in routine general practice in Australia and the USA, and could lead to improved outcomes for patients with depression and other chronic diseases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
