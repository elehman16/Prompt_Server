It typically presents in young adults between 20 and 50 years of age, with a peak occurring at 30 years of age. It is nearly 3 times more common in women. The total number of people living with MS worldwide is estimated to be 2&#x02013;2.5 million. The disease is unevenly distributed throughout the world.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Its prevalence in Isfahan in Iran is almost 43.8 cases per 100,000 people.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>MS causes psychological symptoms due to no conclusive cure and chronic nature of the disease. The studies have shown that psychological disorders such as depression, stress and anxiety in patients with MS are more than healthy individuals.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>In this disease because of the extensive involvement of white matter in sub-cortical and central areas, mental health disorders can also occur.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Depression and anxiety have a point prevalence of 16&#x02013;44%.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In these patients suicidal ideation and attempts are reportedly 2&#x02013;7.5 times higher than the general population.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] As another sign involved in MS, stress has been widely studied and very often is known as the agent of relapsing. Many MS patients report that their symptoms go worse as a result of stress. Anxiety, stress, and depression have a major role in triggering the onset of the attack, while there is no cure for MS.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Management of symptoms in MS thus becomes a critical issue, since these will inevitably lead to negative effects of daily living, social roles, professional and family involvement.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Studies have shown that complementary medicine is used in patients with MS is more than in the general population.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Fear of medication side-effects and desire for symptom relief are possible reasons for the increasing use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) by MS patients, however many CAM modalities do not have enough scientific evidence to support their efficacy and safety. Therefore, nurses are in a unique position to assess client needs for these interventions to evaluate the strength of evidence and to adopt evidenced-based modalities.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Prevalence of use of complementary therapies including reflexology and relaxation are increasing among people with MS but there is not enough evidence to support their effectiveness.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Relaxation technique reduces pressure and muscle contraction and is a tool to increase relaxation of the body and the mind.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Reflexology is performed using the thumb and forefinger to apply pressure to specific areas on the feet that have been claimed to correspond to the internal organs.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>It is well acknowledged that foot reflexology therapy effectively facilitates blood and lymph circulation which accelerate the excretion of waste, soften, and stabilize the movement of muscle, joints, and tendons, reinforce muscle strength, and promote relaxation.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In addition, the human touch accompanied by reflexology offers care and attention for patients, and this psychological comforting has been reported as a primary benefit of the reflexology.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Other hypotheses relate to improvement of blood flow; the theories that reflex points are nerve receptors, the stimulation of which reduces muscular or psychological tension, inducing deep relaxation[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and about the relaxation, studies have found reduced sympathetic nervous system activity and salivary cortisol levels following relaxation training.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] These are several hypotheses relate to these methods which have, so far, not been submitted to sufficient experimental testing. Future investigations might address these issues.</p><p>Studies have shown that 64.9&#x02013;84% patients with MS use at least one of complementary medicine therapies such as reflexology and relaxation,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] while their applications has not been specifically evaluated and thus information about possible side-effects is limited, leading to a lack of understanding of the safest and most effective complementary therapies.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Therefore, this study was aimed to compare the effects of reflexology and relaxation on anxiety, stress and depression in women suffering MS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study is a single-blind randomized clinical trial with three groups that is done on 75 patients with MS referred to MS Clinic of Ayatollah Kashani Hospital (Isfahan, Iran) in during April 2014&#x02013;July 2014 and is the result of part of the research plan approved by Ethical Committee and research vice chancellery of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. This research been registered in center clinical trial of Iran with number 2014050117387.</p><p>The sample size was calculated with the power = 80% and &#x003b1; = 0.05 equal proportions of experimental and control groups. Each group was determined to have 30 patients (totally 90 patients), which 15 patients were excluded from the research (two subjects due to leg fracture, one subject due to hospitalization for plasmapheresis and 12 subjects due to unwillingness to participation) and in the end, the research was conducted on 75 patients (25 in the reflexology group, 25 in the relaxation group and 25 in the control group) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Patient disposition</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JEHP-6-11-g001"/></fig><p>The participants were randomly assigned by minimization method with MiniPy software to three groups: Reflexology, relaxation and control. In the process of randomization it is probable that the treatment groups develop significant differences in some prognostic factors, especially when the sample size is relatively small (&#x0003c;200). If these factors have important effects on the primary or secondary outcomes of the study, any important difference in the levels of these factors invalidate the trial results, and necessitate complicated statistical analysis. Various methods have been used to overcome the problem of unmatched trial groups, including minimization and stratification, with minimization providing more acceptable results.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Inclusion criteria were: Female patients with a definite diagnosis of MS (relapsing-remitting, primary progressive and secondary progressive) by a medicine specialist, has not received a series of reflexology treatments or formally taught and practiced relaxation.

The first part of the questionnaire involved demographic data such as age, marital status, educational degree, and employment status. The second part was about the characteristics of the disease with four questions including duration, the clinical pattern of MS, medication and symptoms of disease. The third part was depression anxiety and stress scale-21 (DASS-21) to assess depression, anxiety, and stress in which each cluster of seven items measures one factor or emotional state. Each question has a Likert scale from 0 to 3. Ghafari <italic>et al</italic>. calculated internal consistency for DASS-21 scale using Cronbach's alpha and the results for scales of depression, anxiety, and stress equal 0.97, 0.71, and 0.74 respectively.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The validity of the first and second part of the questionnaire was approved by 10 faculty members of the School of Nursing and Midwifery at Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. In order to assess the reliability, the questionnaires were given to 10 patients with MS after 10 days; the questionnaires were distributed among the same people and collected again. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the scores of the items of the questionnaire was calculated. The reliability of the questionnaire was confirmed with a value of 0.85. The Questionnaire was completed before, immediately and 2 months after interventions by questioner. Questioner was unaware of the type of interventions about the samples.</p><p>Relaxation technique was the combination of Jacobson and Benson was used compound relaxation method via audio tape. The Jacobson method followed previously standardized and validated procedures of Bernstein and Borkovic based on a classic muscle relaxation program by Jacobson. This technique involved systematically relaxing the major muscle groups of the body with the goal of physical and mental relaxation.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Patients were divided into five groups (consisting of five patients in each group). The subjects were taught as to how to relax and contract the muscles of the body. They contracted and relaxed each muscle group for 5 and 15s, respectively. They focused their attention on their respiration and they visualized a beach, a village, or a beautiful garden and relaxed in a comforting opportunity. Participants were asked to put themselves in comfortable conditions. Before treatment participants were also recommended to wear comfortable clothing. The patients were told not to use the techniques alone at home until the end of the study.</p><p>In reflexology group first the legs were washed with body shampoo and dried. Then, the subjects were placed in a comfortable position, usually lying on the back, with their pants being removed up to their knees. While standing in front of the patient, the researcher started general reflexology with massage all reflex points in plantar with thumb and fore finger and then specialized reflexology was done through the pressure point of foot reflex such as (solar plexus, hypothalamic, pituitary, spinal cord, (K1), and adrenal gland sand pelvic). First, for the left foot and then for the right foot (20 min each). Index and pointing fingers were placed on reflex points. They moved apart and reached back for several times in a worm-like movement. The major reflexive points in the feet were put under pressure using the thumb and index finger. Finally, the intervention was completed by the researcher with massage of the solar plexus.</p><p>The interventions of reflexology and relaxation were performed for 4 weeks, twice a week for 40 min in each session, in a bright, silent, warm room with suitable temperature and ventilation at Kashani MS Clinic and the control group were received care and routine medical treatment as directed by a doctor. All patients in each group were informed of the details of the procedures and of the details of the study.
