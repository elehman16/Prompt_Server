In all subjects were applied the following tests: Scale for compulsive appetite (SCA) and Scale of interest for own weight, both for eating disorders, CAGE questionnaire for alcohol dependence and two scales for determining: the gender&#x02013;role ambivalence (O'Neil and Caroll Scale) and the masculinity and feminity index (A. Chelcea). The results obtained in both lots of Romanian women with pathologic behavior (food and/or alcohol consumption) have indicated a low psycho&#x02013;sexual identity versus control group but no correlation with masculinity/feminity index.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>eating disorders</kwd><kwd>psycho&#x02013;sexual identity</kwd><kwd>alcoholism</kwd><kwd>gender/role atributes</kwd><kwd>masculinity/feminity index</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="Introduction" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The studies made in the last decades gathered information about feeding disturbances and substances abuse. The researchers had examined personality traits, family history biological and cultural background. Due to the fact that a large number of persons with feeding problems are women (90&#x02013;95%) must be considered the role of gender&#x02013;masculinity and feminity&#x02013;in the development of feeding problems and alcohol consumption.</p><p>It was suggested that both food and alcohol consumption disturbances are <bold>manifestations of an addictive type of personality</bold>. Other explanations include a) existence of a biological determination b) a dysfunctional family environment c) a fundamental struggle with a weak self control  d) insufficient abilities to cope with the stress and depression. However all these explanation ignores some other aspects of social and cultural context in which food and alcohol intake problems occur.</p><p>The study of psychosexual identity as well as the womanhood and manhood coefficient is another way to examine this context</p><p>In the same time undertaking a psychosexual identity is tight related to self acceptance, a component of the self with a wider conceptual sphere including other personality attributes: positives (qualities) and negatives (flaws).</p><p>Women with gender&#x02013;role attributes feebly defined are much more probable to have a slender self acceptance thus making them more vulnerable to problems involving feeding and alcohol consumption.</p><p>Defining <bold>self acceptance/ self esteem </bold>(two notions not entirely overlapping) Crisp and Turner (2008) deemed that being an evaluative component of the self designated to establish our rank among the others including towards the standards / role models deemed being positive or negative. Self acceptance nuances the evaluation of self image (bringing into light of conscience of own thoughts, emotions, behaviors)  in axiological way , representing also an attitude of being or not in agreement with that image.</p><p><bold>Self acceptance</bold> it makes reference to the adaptive role of self and it is expressed trough its continuous tendency to diminish the tension therefore ensuring the equilibrium and peace. Self acceptance has as main goal to gain the gratification on imaginative or symbolic level. Self acceptance ponder itself in a good positive opinion being compatible with a person full of trust and worth, a person who take both praises and disapprovals in an objective manner. Attitude of a positive self image person it is based on inner values and who accepts the consequences occurring from own behaviors. </p><p>A low degree of self acceptance is translated in a negative opinion towards self and the conviction that others too have the same opinion.</p><p>That independent variable could have following levels: a low degree of self acceptance, a medium or normal degree, and a high degree of self acceptance.</p><p>Self acceptance plays a key role in development of a personality and a self and it's a major component of our emotional health</p><p>If both Kahn and Singha had discovered a positive correlation between low self esteem and feeding and alcohol intake disorders, then   Striegel&#x02013;Moore (1993) opinionate that   stress induced by the image of own body could too determinates women to involve in abusive behaviors like excess drinking or  food disorders (bulimia anorexia obesity) . In other words, low self esteem could be both result and cause of such behaviors. The present work has as intention to analyze these personality traits from perspective of considering personality as a crucial factor in genesis of feeding disorders and alcoholism. </p></sec><sec sec-type="Theoretical Objectives" id="sec1-2"><title>Theoretical Objectives</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Discovering the influence of the social cultural environment in the rate of feeding disorders at women and more specific if under influence of social and cultural environment some people are more susceptible than others to feeding disorders and alcoholism.

Because the number of persons affected by alcoholism is higher among men the problem of women's alcoholism was not enough studied and maybe therefore the number of women involved in alcohol related problem is raising in real life.</p><p>Therewith prevention and treatment programs regarding alcoholism in our country and not only, doesn't take account of clinical, psychological and social features specific to women with an alcohol related problem and thus the healing is more difficult to attain.</p><p>This study is motivated by the willing of a differentiate approach to alcoholism at women, and that approach should be regarded in the wider context of alcoholic woman's psychology </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="Research Hypothesis" id="sec1-4"><title>Research Hypothesis</title><p>General hypothesis: We suppose that women who manifest feeding and alcohol consumption problems will be low in self acceptance</p><p>Independent variable: disorders of feeding and alcohol consumption (TAA)</p><p>Dependent Variable: self acceptance

High scores reveals a higher compulsivity in somebody appetite.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Scale regarding diet and own weight preoccupation: made by Dona Kagan and Rose Squires it consist of 14 items designated to measure the interest for own weight and diet as result of a feeding disturbance. The main purpose of this scale: to measure dieting behaviour. At this scale the score represents the sum of values of all items and may vary from 14 to 70. High scores reflects a higher interest in dieting and maintaining own weight in certain limits.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cage Questionnaire:  elaborated by R. Brown and L.

This questionnaire was designated to test alcoholism and represents an acronym of four behavioral parameters at persons with drinking problems: Cut down&#x02013;persistent wish to cut down alcohol consumption, Annoyed&#x02013;continuous reproaches from those around him, Guilty&#x02013;self culpabilisation, Eye opener&#x02013;the morning shot as an invigorating treat</p></list-item><list-item><p>Scale of self acceptance created by Emanuel Berger one of the oldest scales that measures the self acceptance and self esteem. Description: The inner image of the self, present in everybody's mind is a portrait based on our own social experiences. Based upon earlier activity of Dr. Elisabeth Scheerer and Dr. Carl Rogers, Dr. Berger listed 9 characteristics of self acceptance such as: &#x02018;He have trust in his own capabilities to manage his way in life&#x02019;. This formula lead to selection and development of a final group of 36 items for self, used to build the self acceptance scale. That scale is frequently used today in the whole world as well as for research and also in medical psychology and psychiatry to measure and characterize in a multi axial way the self esteem and self acceptance.

The others may see that person being very affable because he/she accepts both praises and critics in an objective manner. Attitude of such a person is based upon inner values and accepting consequences resulting from own behaviors. </p></sec><sec sec-type="Method" id="sec1-7"><title>Methods|materials</title><p>The present research has the purpose to demonstrate the existence of a correlation between alcohol and eating disorders (TAA) on a side and self acceptance on another, following that in other work to be analyzed the results of correlation between psychosexual identity and masculinity and femininity quotient.</p><p>Independent variable is constituted by the problems related to eating and drinking. About eating we have in view women   diagnosed with bulimia, anorexia, obesity and harsh, punishing diets.

</p><p>In the first general hypothesis the result obtained at self acceptance test by control group and work group 1 were compared. Because admittance in those two work groups was made upon positive results at those two scales regarding eating problems (1. compulsive appetite 2. diet and weight control preoccupation) on a side and CAGE questionnaire regarding overdrinking on the other side, only a comparative display of the results obtained at the Berger scale of self acceptance by both groups will be made.</p></sec><sec sec-type="Results" id="sec1-8"><title>Results</title><p>The result were corroborated with psychiatrist   diagnoses  and they are displayed at <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref></p><p>General hypothesis 1: If women present eating disorders then they will have a lower self acceptance.
