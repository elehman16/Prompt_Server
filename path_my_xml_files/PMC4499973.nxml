and corrected head positions. [Subjects and Methods] Forty subjects with a forward head
posture and rounded shoulder were recruited and randomly assigned to the natural head
position group (<italic>n</italic> = 13), ideal head position group (<italic>n</italic> =
14), or corrected head position group (<italic>n</italic> = 13). Muscle activities were
measured using a four-channel surface electromyography system at the
sternocleidomastoideus, upper and lower trapezius, and serratus anterior muscles on the
right side during an overhead reaching task. [Results] The muscle activities of the upper
trapezius and serratus anterior differed significantly among head positions. Post hoc
tests revealed significant differences between natural and ideal head positions, and
natural and ideal head positions for both the upper trapezius and serratus anterior.
[Conclusion] Recovery of normal upper trapezius and serratus anterior muscle functions
plays an important role in correcting forward head posture and rounded shoulders.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Forward head posture</kwd><kwd>Muscle activity</kwd><kwd>Round shoulder</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>People sit with their head positioned in various ways; this is determined by a combination
of factors including musculoskeletal structure, age-related body changes, motor performance,
occupation, and cultural customs<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. A forward head posture with rounded
shoulders (FHPRS) due to a poor sitting posture is defined as a forward head position with
thoracic kyphosis and more anterior shoulder positions; such a posture is associated with
altered scapular positions, kinematics, and muscle activities<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. These alterations consequently increase muscle tension and stress
at the neck and shoulder, resulting in pain, numbness, loss of function, and various
neuromuscular symptoms, which most often affect the upper body<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>While sitting, forward head inclination involves a combination of lower cervical flexion,
upper cervical extension, and rounded shoulders, which reduce the average lengths of muscle
fibers, contributing to extensor torque around the upper cervical joint. In addition, this
abnormal state causes musculoskeletal abnormalities such as decreased scapular upward
rotation as well as greater internal rotation and anterior tilting, which may lead to
difficulties maintaining an upright sitting posture<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many previous studies report that proper head position is a state of musculoskeletal
balance that involves minimizing the stresses and strains acting on the upper body<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Frequent correction to an upright neutral
postural position serves two functions. First, it may provide regular reductions of adverse
loads on the cervical joints induced by poor spinal, cervical, and scapular postures.
Second, it may train the deep postural-stabilizing muscles of the spine to better perform
their functional postural-supporting role. Hence, assuming a proper head position is a
common approach for the treatment of neck and shoulder pain syndromes. In addition,
different sitting postures lead to different shoulder kinematics and muscle activities. In
particular, an upright sitting posture reduces activation of the upper trapezius. Previous
studies indicate a neutral upright posture is difficult to achieve without manual or verbal
feedback<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, this remains controversial, as several authors report
subjectively perceived ideal postures produce results similar to postures corrected by
therapists, positively affecting shoulder kinematics and muscle activities<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the present study examined whether different head
positions influence upper-extremity muscle activities in people with an FHPRS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Forty subjects with an FHPRS were recruited. The subjects had no history of neck or
shoulder pain, or current pain, upper-limb injury, cervical or thoracic musculoskeletal
pathology, or neurological disorder limiting activities. An FHPRS was defined as a forward
head angle (FHA) &#x02264;54.0&#x000b0; and a forward shoulder angle (FSA) &#x02264;50.0&#x000b0; measured on the basis of
previously described observational and photogrammetry methods<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. All subjects provided written informed consent prior to
participation. This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the
Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval was obtained from the local university research
ethics committee.</p><p>Subjects were asked to adopt three head positions while sitting postures: a natural head
position (NHP), ideal head position (IHP), and corrected head position (CHP). For the NHP,
subjects were instructed to sit in a comfortable relaxed position using a verbal instruction
similar to &#x0201c;sit as you usually do&#x0201d; while looking at a fixed point directly ahead. For the
IHP, subjects were instructed to sit with the head in a &#x0201c;balanced position&#x0201d; considered by
the subjects to be ideal without any manual or verbal feedback regarding the position
adopted. For the CHP, the subjects were placed in a neutral posture by experienced
therapists using manual and verbal feedback to reflect clinical practice. Each posture was
held for 10 seconds and repeated 3 times, and a 10-second rest period was allowed between
repetitions.</p><p>Head and shoulder postures were assessed using a digital imaging technique arranged to
capture the sagittal plane of the upper body in a sitting position. A digital camera (EOS
1000D, Cannon, Japan) was placed on a tripod 1&#x02005;m high and 3.5&#x02005;m from the wall on a fixed
level base. Before capturing sagittal images, subjects were asked to move their heads
forward and backward through the full range of motion three times and then return to the
starting position looking directly ahead. Reflective markers were placed on the tragus of
the right ear, acromion, and C7 spinous process. Adobe Photoshop version 7.0 (San Jose, CA,
USA) was used to determine FHAs and FSAs from lateral view in photographs. The FHA was
determined from the vertical anterior to the line between the tragus of ear and C7 spinous
process. The FSA was determined by measuring from the vertical posterior to a line between
the C7 spinous process and acromion. These measures have been used in previous studies, and
their intra- and inter-rater reliabilities are well established<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Muscle activity was measured using a four-channel surface electromyography (EMG) system
(MP30, Biopac, Goleta, CA, USA). EMG signals were recorded using a pre-amplified electrode
(Biopac System, Biopac, USA). In each head position, muscle activity was measured during an
overhead reaching task in 3 sessions comprising 3 repetitions with a 30-second rest periods
between repetitions. All subjects were instructed to raise their right arm from a relaxed
side position up to 180&#x000b0; at a self-selected speed, with the elbows straight and shoulders
non-elevated while holding a weight equal to 3% of body weight. The muscle activities of the
sternocleidomastoideus (SCM), upper and lower trapezius (UT and LT, respectively), and
serratus anterior (SA) were measured on the right side during the overhead reaching task.
The EMG electrode locations were as follows: (1) SCM, lower third of the line connecting the
sternal notch and mastoid process<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>; (2)
UT, lateral to the midpoint of an imaginary line formed by the posterior aspect of the
acromion and the spinous process of C7<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>;
(3) LT, next to the medial edge of the scapula at an oblique angle of 55&#x000b0;<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>; (4) SA, on the midaxillary line of the
right fifth rib<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. A ground electrode was
placed on the right clavicle. For statistical analysis, EMG signal data were sampled at
1,000&#x02005;Hz, bandpass filtered between 10 and 500&#x02005;Hz, and converted to digital signals using
Acknowledge software (Biopac System, Biopac, USA). The root mean square values of EMG data
were calculated, and maximum EMG signals, which were used for normalization purposes, were
acquired during maximum voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) for 5 seconds. The values
obtained during the first and last second were discarded, and average root mean square
values of the remaining 3 seconds were calculated. %MVIC was measured three times with a
60-second rest period between each MVIC trial. The mean %MVIC values were subsequently
calculated and analyzed.</p><p>Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS version 18.0 for Windows. All results are
presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. Demographic data including age, height, and weight
were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. Postural angles (i.e., FHA and FSA) and muscle activities
(i.e., SCM, UT, LT, and SA) in different head positions (i.e., NHP, IHP, and CHP) were
analyzed by one-way ANOVA and the Tukey LSD post hoc test. The level of significance was set
at p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were no significant differences among three head position groups with respect to sex,

than the NHP group. Moreover, the IHP increased the FHA and FSA to almost the same extent as
the CHP, which was corrected by a therapist. Meanwhile, the muscle activities of the UT and
SA were lower in the IHP and CHP group than the NHP group. These results suggest the effects
of the IHP are similar to those of the CHP.</p><p>The present findings demonstrate the IHP and CHP improved shoulder kinetics and movement
patterns Thus, these finding indicate the IHP improves shoulder kinetics and muscle
activities in individuals with an FHPRS during an overhead reaching task. Scapular anterior
tilting and internal rotation have been reported in individuals with an FHPRS in comparison
to individuals with an ideal posture<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, the NHP is reported to be associated with increased
thoracic flexion and head/neck flexion with a greater anterior translation of the head, when
compared to neutral head-neck alignment with shoulder blades slightly retracted<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The differences between postures with
respect to the FHA and FSA are likely due to muscular imbalances around the shoulder girdle,
because we measured UT and SA muscle activities.</p><p>Several studies report that SA, UT, and LT activities are important factors in an
FHPRS<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, the SA contributes to and controls many scapular
movements such as anterior/posterior tilting and upward/downward rotation<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. When an FHPRS alters scapular kinematics,
SA activation is consequently changed. In addition, an FHPRS is reported to lead to thoracic
kyphosis, resulting in decreased scapular upward rotation<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, SA muscle activity must increase to compensate for
abnormal scapular movement, i.e., the SA muscle must overcome the resistance generated by
passive tension around the scapulae in abnormal postures such as an FHPRS.</p><p>Trapezius muscle activity is thought to be elevated in an FHPRS<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. An FHPRS is reported to shorten and increase the tension
of the levator scapula<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. As the levator
scapula and trapezius are the antagonist and agonist muscles for scapular upward rotation,
respectively, upward rotation of the scapula is prohibited if the tension of the levator
scapula is increased by an FHPRS. In order to compensate for this abnormal mechanism, the
trapezius muscle should be more activated for greater extension<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, the trapezius generates a coupling force
with the serratus anterior, resulting in altered movements such as excessive upward rotation
and anterior tilting.</p><p>In conclusion, the findings of this study indicate different head positions have different
effects on head/shoulder kinematics and muscle activities. The results corroborate the
clinical notion that postural alterations related to an FHPRS can change scapular kinematics
and muscle activities in individuals with such a posture<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, recovery of normal functions of the UT and SA plays an
important role in correcting an FHPRS. However, we did not divide upper- and lower-cervical
spine kinetics into deep and superficial cervical categories. Furthermore, the suboccipital
muscles were not assessed. Therefore, further studies should be conducted to determine the
roles of other muscles and relationships between habitual posture and movements of the
scapulae and shoulders.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Yoo</surname><given-names>WG</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Effects of overhead work involving different heights and
