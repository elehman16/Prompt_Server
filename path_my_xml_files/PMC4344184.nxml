In additional to pharmacological treatments, psychotherapeutic treatments are also highly effective.

Persistent avoidance of stimuli, slow responses (eg, feelings of isolation and loss of personal interests), re-experiencing the trauma (unavoidable recall of the traumatic event, nightmares), and increased autonomic stimulation (hyper activity, irritability, and sleep disorders) are the main symptoms of this condition, observable shortly after onset.<xref rid="b1-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Whereas not everyone exposed to such life events develops PTSD, in the USA, it occurs among 10% of women and 5% of men who were previously exposed to such kind of live events.<xref rid="b2-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Moreover, the life-time risk in the general population of developing at least one episode of PTSD is estimated to be 8%&#x02013;9%.<xref rid="b3-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In addition to flashbacks, nightmares are often reported by those suffering from PTSD. In this context, sleep disorders comprise about 70% of the complaints of patients with PTSD.<xref rid="b4-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> They are also more likely to commit suicide than persons without PTSD.<xref rid="b6-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The risk of suicide among those with PTSD is higher for people reporting nightmares than for those who do not.<xref rid="b8-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Accordingly, symptoms need to be recognized and treated appropriately if they are not to become persistent.<xref rid="b9-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In addition, patients with PTSD are at high risk of developing comorbid psychiatric disorders such as mood, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders. Furthermore, the high chronicity, severity, and comorbidity of PTSD are associated with high levels of functional and psychosocial disability,<xref rid="b10-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and also with dramatic impairments in memory and autobiographical memory.<xref rid="b11-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Accordingly, in the present study, we investigated the influence of additional CBT on the autobiographical memory of patients with PTSD.</p><p>As regards treatment interventions, PTSD can be treated both pharmacologically and non-pharmacologically; that is, psychotherapeutically. Depending on symptom severity and comorbid disorders, pharmacological treatment typically involves administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), benzodiazepines, and antipsychotics. Diverse medication classes, including antidepressants, anticonvulsants, antipsychotics and antiadrenergic drugs have been used to treat PTSD. Thereby, antidepressants are the most used and prescribed medication for PTSD,<xref rid="b3-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and SSRIs are the only class of medication approved for treatment of PTSD in the USA. SSRIs seem to be safer and better tolerated than other psychotropic medications and many of the clinical trials showed that there is evidence of best efficacy in reducing PTSD symptoms for this class of medication.<xref rid="b3-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> SSRIs have shown to be efficient in reducing symptom severity and in preventing PTSD patients from relapsing, although just a few patients (about 60%) respond to treatment and only approximately 20%&#x02013;30% have been fully remitted.<xref rid="b12-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> SSRI paroxetine, for example, succeeded in effective reduction of symptoms of all three PTSD symptom clusters, namely re-experiencing of the trauma, increased arousal, and avoidance of situations that resemble the traumatic event.<xref rid="b10-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Among the empirically-supported psychotherapeutic interventions are trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), exposure-based therapy, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing,<xref rid="b10-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> stress inoculated training, and CBT.<xref rid="b12-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Further, prolonged exposure is the most researched and best validated non-pharmacological treatment for PTSD.<xref rid="b3-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In the present study, we focused on CBT.</p><p>Several placebo-controlled trials and meta-analyses support the view that these non-pharmacological treatments are effective in reducing PTSD symptoms.<xref rid="b13-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> International guidelines recommend non-pharmacological treatment for all PTSD patients as the first option (Polak et al<xref rid="b10-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and pharmacological treatment as a second option, but no consensus has been achieved on these alternatives so far.<xref rid="b3-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> More specifically, and contrary to Polak et al,<xref rid="b10-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Ipser et al<xref rid="b14-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> concluded based on a Cochrane review that medication treatments can be effective in treating PTSD, and should be considered as a part of the treatment of PTSD, with the application SSRIs as first-line agents in the pharmacotherapy of PTSD. However, we also note that the Institute of Medicine Report concluded that there was no evidence that one of the several medication classes was effective for treatment of PTSD, while the UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence recommended in 2005 that medications should only be used as a second-line treatment for PTSD.<xref rid="b3-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> This may also be due to the much higher treatment costs for pharmacotherapies in comparison to psychotherapies, especially in relation to higher expected relapse rates with pharmacotherapies.<xref rid="b10-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Moreover, the efficacy of pharmacological treatment for PTSD may also depend on the type of symptoms. On the other hand, and apparently paradoxically, Mellman et al<xref rid="b16-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> estimated that 77% of PTSD patients in a community-based sample received pharmacotherapy. This high rate for pharmacotherapy may reflect the low availability and accessibility of psychotherapy.<xref rid="b10-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> There is also some evidence that those patients who report more severe sleep difficulties have poorer treatment outcomes with psychotherapy.<xref rid="b3-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Last, combined pharmacotherapy and psychological therapies are especially recommended when patients have not responded to either intervention alone,<xref rid="b16-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and this needs to be further examined in future research.<xref rid="b18-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>A further issue of PTSD regards memory performance, in that one of the most serious and frequent symptoms of PTSD is intrusive memories of the traumatic event.<xref rid="b20-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Since PTSD symptoms often persist long after exposure to the traumatic event, researchers have given particular attention to memory as a key factor in the pathogenesis of the disorder.<xref rid="b22-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Most strikingly, there is evidence that PTSD patients show difficulties in retrieval of autobiographical memories.<xref rid="b21-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In addition, patients with PTSD tend to report more memories related to the traumatic event compared to people without PTSD.<xref rid="b20-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> They tend to exhibit difficulties in recalling specific memories; producing a so-called &#x0201c;overgeneralized&#x0201d; autobiographical memory.</p><p>Furthermore, it is not only autobiographical memories that are characterized by overgeneralization. Expectations that individuals with PTSD have about imagined future events are also characterized by overgeneralization.<xref rid="b20-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Overgeneralized autobiographical memory has been implicated as an important mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of PTSD, and the close connection between overgeneralization in autobiographical memory and in thinking about the future seems to be conducive to the onset and maintenance of the disorder.<xref rid="b22-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> To summarize, PTSD is a severe psychiatric disorder, affecting patients&#x02019; emotions, behavior, social life, and cognitions. With respect to cognitions, memory performance, and more specifically, autobiographical memory performance, is impaired. PTSD is treated pharmacologically and non-pharmacologically. From previous research, we learn that the effect of additional CBT in combination with psychopharmacological treatment is poorly investigated, and in particular that the influence of additional CBT on autobiographical memory has not so far been investigated. Accordingly, the aims of the present study were to investigate the influence of additional CBT on symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety, and on autobiographical memory in patients suffering from PTSD, as compared to a control condition. We hold that the present study has the potential to expand on previous research in that the data from both the case-control design and the study targets should add to the current literature in an important way.</p><p>The following two hypotheses were formulated. First, following Hendriksen et al,<xref rid="b12-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Polak et al<xref rid="b10-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and others, we expected improved symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety in the CBT as compared to the control group. Second, following Brown et al<xref rid="b21-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> we expected that autobiographic memory performance would be low at baseline and would improve in the treatment as compared to the control group. Additionally, given the lack of previous research, we treated exploratory potential changes in autobiographical memory as a function of domain (semantic and episodic memory) and developmental period (childhood, adulthood, and recent life).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>Patients clinically diagnosed as suffering from PTSD (accident-related injuries, cancer, domestic violence) participated in this study. They were all recruited from the Sina Hospital, Mahak (cancer foundation), and from psychiatric and psychological centers in Tehran, Iran. Before entering the study, patients were fully informed about its aims, scope, and procedures and gave written informed consent. Additionally, the local ethics committee approved the study, and the entire study was performed according to the rules laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>After a thorough psychiatric interview, all patients were psychopharmacologically treated with SSRIs, neuroleptics, or benzodiazepines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ndt-11-395">Table 1</xref>). Dosages were individually adapted to patients and kept constant throughout the study in order to achieve and maintain treatment efficacy. Next, patients were randomly assigned either to an intervention or control condition. At the beginning and at the end of the study 10 weeks later, patients completed a series of questionnaires as described in more details below, and experts&#x02019; ratings were performed in parallel. In addition to the diagnostic interview, both groups had the autobiographical memory interview. After completion of the study, patients in the control condition received the same treatment as that provided for the intervention group. Psychologists and psychiatrists involved in the study and responsible for experts&#x02019; ratings were not aware of patients&#x02019; group assignment.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>First, a ballot box containing two different colored chips was prepared (20 blue chips for the intervention, and 20 red chips for the control condition). A psychologist (FA) drew chips consecutively and assigned patients to either to the intervention or control condition. FA was also responsible for the psychotherapeutic intervention, though she was not further involved in experts&#x02019; ratings.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample</title><p>Patients suffering from PTSD and attending the Sina Hospital, Mahak (cancer foundation), and other psychiatric and psychological centers in Tehran, Iran were approached regarding the study. The CONSORT flow chart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ndt-11-395">Figure 1</xref>) indicates how many patients were approached, and how many completed the study. Of the 76 patients approached, 40 (52.63%) agreed to participate in the study. Further, 12 patients, who were randomly assigned to the intervention or the control condition, withdraw after randomization and baseline assessment; accordingly, 28 patients started the study. Of these, six (21.43%) were male (mean age: 29.50 years, standard deviation: 4.97) and 22 (78.57%) were female (mean age: 32.23 years, standard deviation: 6.02; <italic>t</italic>[26]=1.02, <italic>P</italic>=0.32, <italic>d</italic>=0.496). Please note that to perform the statistical analysis, the intent-to-treat algorithm with the last observation carried forward procedure was performed, and not the per protocol algorithm (see also the &#x0201c;Statistical analysis&#x0201d; section at the end of the &#x0201c;Methods&#x0201d; section).</p><p>Inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) a diagnosis of PTSD according to the diagnostic criteria of the <italic>DSM-5</italic>;<xref rid="b23-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and 2) aged between 18 and 45 years. Exclusion criteria were the following: 1) further psychiatric comorbidities such as major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, substance abuse (alcohol, drugs), psychosis, and personality disorders; 2) women who were pregnant or intending to get pregnant or who were breast-feeding; 3) known physical illness such as heart disease; and 4) patients already undergoing a psychotherapeutic treatment.

Accordingly, the present results are in accordance with a wealth of previous research that has shown a favorable influence of (additional) CBT in the treatment of PTSD, as compared to pharmacological treatment alone.<xref rid="b10-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b12-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b17-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> However, the present study expands on previous research in showing that a highly standardized group therapy for ten sessions over a period of 10 weeks improved symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety.</p><p>Our second hypothesis was that additional CBT would also improve dimensions of autobiographical memory, and this was broadly supported. Specifically, for autobiographical memory performance for adulthood and the current period of life, the group by time interaction showed that additional CBT led to a significant improvement for semantic memory (but not episodic memory) for adult memory, whereas for recent memory, additional CBT improved episodic memory (but not semantic memory). To the best of our knowledge, similar findings have not so far been reported; accordingly the present study expands upon existing research on PTSD in demonstrating that highly standardized CBT intervention has a positive influence not only on symptoms but also on autobiographical memory.</p><p>The present data do not allow any deeper understanding of the underlying cognitive&#x02013;emotional and neurophysiological mechanisms. However, the following hypotheses are advanced.</p><p>As regards the cognitive&#x02013;emotional changes, we note that the CBT program was specifically targeted at changing and favorably modifying dysfunctional thoughts (see &#x0201c;Methods&#x0201d; section). Accordingly, we assume that patients in the intervention group learned to restructure and positively alter their dysfunctional thoughts and emotions, which as a result reduced symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. To illustrate, by the second session, patients in the intervention group were already listing their thoughts and negative believes about PTSD and were evaluating the extent to which their behavior was causally associated with the dramatic event leading to PTSD. Likewise they were also evaluating the degree to which they were victims of the event, and the thoughts and feelings associated with it, and, in contrast, to what extent they could learn to manage, modify, and improve their thoughts. Connected to this, we believe that through the CBT intervention, patients became aware of their (unconscious) dysfunctional thoughts and beliefs and learned to evaluate the extent to which their thoughts and feelings were causally linked to the emergence and maintenance of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD, and that they learned how to cope with their current situation. On the flip side, we note that favorable changes in symptoms and memory were also observed in the control group. Therefore, the present data also show evidence that a mere psychopharmacological treatment leads to improvements both in symptoms and in memory (see also Polak et al,<xref rid="b10-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Ipser et al<xref rid="b14-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>To explain PTSD from a neuroendocrinologic point of view, it is assumed that an increase in the adrenergic activity of the central nervous system (CNS) is associated with the pathophysiology of PTSD and more specifically with sleep disorders.<xref rid="b29-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In fact, it seems that many of the symptoms of PTSD could be pathophysiologically caused or intensified by an increase in the adrenergic activity of the CNS.<xref rid="b29-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b30-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Such an increase in adrenergic activity can lead to increased secretion of norepinephrine and to elevated responsiveness of receptors to norepinephrine. Accordingly, though highly speculative, we suggest that CBT was able to decrease the adrenergic activity in the CNS. Likewise, though unfortunately not assessed, we believe that CBT was able to improve patients&#x02019; sleep, which in turn may have led to improvement in symptoms. Indeed, there is a wealth of evidence for a close association between symptoms of depression and anxiety and poor sleep.<xref rid="b31-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b33-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Accordingly, it is highly conceivable that the sleep of patients in the intervention group improved, and in a sort of positive feedback loop this also ameliorated symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Indeed, as regards the association between sleep and PTSD, specific alpha1-receptor-blockers such as prazosin and specific H1-receptor blockers such as hydroxyzine reduce occurrence of nightmares and sleep disturbances among patients suffering from PTSD as compared to a control condition.<xref rid="b35-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>Despite the intriguing results, several limitations warn against overgeneralizing the results. First, the sample size was rather small and there were drop-outs. However, the effect-size calculations which we report are not sensitive to sample sizes. Second, the age range was limited to below 45 years of age; we did this to keep the sample homogeneous and to avoid possible confounders such as age. Nevertheless, we acknowledge, that also enrolling elderly patients would have been advisable, especially given that an emphasis of the study was on autobiographical memory, which would be expected to be worse, and therefore possible more amenable to treatment, in older subjects. Third, sleep was not assessed though there is striking evidence that improved sleep is associated with improvements in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD.<xref rid="b32-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b34-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Accordingly, it remains unclear to what extend sleep changes might explain the variance in symptom improvements. Future studies should therefore assess sleep both subjectively and objectively. Fourth, no neuroendocrine assessment was performed; such assessment might have provided more insight into the underlying neuroendocrine mechanisms.<xref rid="b36-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="b37-ndt-11-395" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Fifth, no follow-up assessment was performed; this would have allowed investigation of the longer-term impact of CBT. Last, it is possible that the present pattern of results is due to unassessed variables, which might have biased two or more variables in the same direction.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study showed that an additional and highly standardized CBT program had a favorable influence on symptoms of PTSD, depression, and
