Changing lifestyle behaviours is difficult and is often predicated on the assumption that individuals are willing to change their lifestyles today to reduce the risk of developing disease years or even decades later. The self-monitoring technologies tested in this study will present PA feedback in real time, parallel with acute physiological data. Presenting the immediate health benefits of being more physically active may help enact change by observing the immediate consequences of that behaviour. The present study aims to assess user engagement with the self-monitoring technologies in individuals at moderate-to-high risk of developing type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>45 individuals with a moderate-to-high risk, aged &#x02265;40 years old and using a compatible smartphone, will be invited to take part in a 7-week protocol. Following 1&#x02009;week of baseline measurements, participants will be randomised into one of three groups: group 1&#x02014; glucose feedback followed by biobehavioural feedback (glucose plus PA); group 2&#x02014;PA feedback followed by biobehavioural feedback; group 3&#x02014;biobehavioural feedback. A PA monitor and a flash glucose monitor will be deployed during the intervention. Participants will wear both devices throughout the intervention but blinded to feedback depending on group allocation. The primary outcome is the level of participant engagement and will be assessed by device use and smartphone usage. Feasibility will be assessed by the practicality of the technology and screening for diabetes risk. Semistructured interviews will be conducted to explore participant experiences using the technologies.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>

Regardless of diagnosis status, preventing the development of type 2 diabetes is an international priority moving forward.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Pre-diabetes, categorised as either impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance represents abnormal glucose homoeostasis and is placed between diabetes and normal regulation. Impaired fasting glucose has been defined as elevated fasting plasma glucose (100&#x02013;126&#x02009;mg/dL) while impaired glucose tolerance is characterised by an elevated 2-hour plasma glucose concentration (140&#x02013;199&#x02009;mg/dL) following intake of a 75&#x02009;g glucose load.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> One in seven adults have impaired glucose regulation<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and, compared with individuals living with normal-circulating glucose levels, individual with pre-diabetes are 5 to 10 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> with 5%&#x02013;10% of people becoming diabetic annually.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Diabetes is projected to be 1 of 10 leading causes of death worldwide<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>; thus, identification and prevention are crucial for early intervention. A lack of physical activity is considered one of the major risk factors for non-communicable diseases and is comparable to the ill-effects of obesity<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and smoking<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> individually. Given that physical inactivity, where insufficient levels of physical activity are achieved, is attributed to an estimated 7% of type 2 diabetes cases,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> it is an important modifiable lifestyle behaviour to target. With the prevalence of impaired fasting glucose doubling in individuals at 40&#x02013;59 years and remaining consistent beyond 60 years,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> targeting efforts towards specific age cohorts is crucial. Individuals with abnormal glucose homoeostasis are referred onto community-based lifestyle behaviour programmes such as The Healthier You: National Diabetes Prevention Programme (NDPP). Initiated in 2016, the programme aims to roll out nationally by 2020 as part of the National Health Service (NHS) Five Year Forward plan.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The present study intends to implement a community screening approach, monitor participant retention and to investigate whether self-monitoring technologies providing feedback about physical activity and interstitial glucose levels play a role in the prevention pathway (which may be amenable to the NDPP framework).</p><p>With increasing recognition towards the integration of technology into usual care pathways (ie, emergence of NHS Digital), it is a crucial time to consider how technologies could contribute to the management of chronic diseases. Given recent consumer interest,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> wearable technologies permit people to self-monitor behaviour and health. Gardner and colleagues<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> reviewed behavioural interventions and identified self-monitoring of behaviour as a particularly promising behaviour change technique. Similarly, continuous glucose monitoring technology has shown promise for longer term physiological outcomes (including glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)),<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> supporting the suggestion that more frequent engagement leads to better health outcomes.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Self-monitoring of both behaviour and outcomes are listed within the taxonomy alongside 91 other ingredients (ie, feedback and goal setting) in behavioural interventions.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> As well as delivering key behaviour change techniques, self-monitoring technologies also support Control Theory.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> More specifically, people are presented with information about a present state via feedback (eg, 9000 steps) and are often provided a set goal to achieve (ie, 10&#x02009;000 steps). Equipped with this information, people may make efforts to achieve the goal or desired outcome (ie, &#x02265;10&#x02009;000 steps) because they have been informed how they are performing relative to it. The majority of research to date has focused on the deployment of technologies to self-monitor movement behaviours<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> or specific health markers<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> in isolation. Although these approaches have shown to be beneficial to behaviour change in the short term, most user engagement is not sustained beyond 6&#x02009;months.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Despite research conducted on short-term improvements, it is not yet clear whether results are sustained with prolonged use.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref> However, the rationale is that when provided with information about their current levels of activity, people may feel motivated to improve their behaviour.</p><p>With a view to sustaining the &#x02018;honeymoon period&#x02019; of technology-bolstered behaviour change, a logical next step would be to deploy wearable technologies in combination. For example, studies investigating the acute effects of brief physical activity bouts or interruptions to prolonged sedentary behaviour on glucose levels in controlled settings have found reductions in postprandial glucose as a result of increased movement.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;30</xref> As a result, the present study proposes that delivering behavioural and physiological feedback in parallel may be more persuasive rather than when delivered in isolation. This approach may offer a platform for people to self-educate themselves about the relationship between movement and acute health status (ie, walking after a meal leads to marked reductions in glucose levels); which may help sustain engagement with self-monitoring technologies. With ongoing developments, technologies such as flash glucose monitoring offer a wealth of information to users without the need for invasive fingerprick samples; offering a useful tool for individuals without diabetes (who are not accustomed to regular fingerprick blood samples).<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> To date, an important limitation of the efforts to encourage people to be more physically active has been the assumption that we are willing to change our lifestyles today to reduce our risk of developing disease years or even decades later. Implementing specific behaviour change techniques such as self-monitoring, goal&#x000a0;setting and feedback,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> wearable devices could empower individuals to manage their health through a change in behaviour by recognising movement patterns and observing influences on health. Building on previous findings which observed greater levels of brain activation in response to personalised glucose-related information (over behavioural information) (Whelan <italic>et al</italic>, submitted), the present study aims to examine the role of providing novel self-monitoring technologies presenting biobehavioural feedback in those living at moderate-to-high risk of type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Aims and objectives</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Primary aim</title><p>The primary aim of this study is to investigate participant engagement using self-monitoring technologies for physical activity and interstitial glucose.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Secondary aims</title><p>The secondary aims of this study are to explore (1) the feasibility of the intervention trial at baseline, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 weeks; (2) levels of physical activity and interstitial glucose levels at baseline, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 weeks&#x000a0;and (3) levels of technology readiness, health literacy, health status and attitudes towards one&#x02019;s own health at baseline and post self-monitoring.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Study setting</title><p>Participants will be recruited from the community in Leicestershire, UK from May to November 2017.

Appointment one will involve informed consent, health measures (height, weight, percentage body fat, waist circumference, blood pressure, HbA1c, grip strength, quadriceps strength and aerobic fitness; full methodological details are provided in the measures section below) and a brief demographics questionnaire. Participants will complete a physical activity readiness questionnaire<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> before completing the aerobic fitness assessment for screening purposes. Participants will be fitted with a waist-worn accelerometer and a wrist-worn activity tracker. Neither device will provide feedback to the participant during the seven consecutive days of wear. Participants will be asked to install two mobile applications onto a personal Android smartphone. Both smartphone applications will sit idle on the smartphone for the duration of baseline. Participants will be asked to sync the activity tracker via the smartphone application; switching on&#x000a0;Wi-Fi and Bluetooth simultaneously at least once every 5&#x02009;days for&#x000a0;&#x02265;1&#x02009;hour to ensure the sync occurs.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Second appointment and intervention</title><p>One week later (following baseline), participants will attend appointment 2 where they will be informed of their group allocation. Participants will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire to continue wearing the activity tracker during the intervention (settings may or may not be adjusted) and to return the accelerometer. A glucose sensor will be deployed to each participant to measure interstitial glucose levels. Participants will be provided with additional supplies of glucose sensors to last for the four (groups 1 and 2) or six&#x02009;weeks (group 3) of the intervention. Accounts for both the activity tracker and glucose sensor will be connected to Diasend (Diasend, Chicago, Ilinois,&#x000a0;USA). An overview of the three groups is provided below.</p><sec id="s4b1"><title>Group 1 (glucose feedback followed by biobehavioural feedback)</title><p>Real-time interstitial glucose feedback will be presented to participants for 4&#x02009;weeks via the LibreLink application (Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, California,&#x000a0;USA). Participants will install the LibreLink mobile application (Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, California,&#x000a0;USA) onto a personal Android smartphone to interact with the Freestyle Libre via NFC for measurement of interstitial glucose. The glucose monitor has a lifespan that restricts wear to 14 consecutive days. The application will remind participants to scan every 7&#x02009;hours and to remove/replace after 14 days. The LibreLink application will continuously display the number of days left.</p></sec><sec id="s4b2"><title>Group 2 (physical activity feedback followed by biobehavioural feedback)</title><p>Real-time physical activity feedback will be presented for 4&#x02009;weeks via the Fitbit application. In contrast to group 1, participants will not have the LibreLink application installed and so will not have access to glucose feedback. Participants will be informed that the glucose sensor is functional (recording data) and participants will be asked to remove and replace the expired sensor with another sensor after 14 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4b3"><title>Device unmasking for groups 1 and 2 after 4&#x02009;weeks</title><p>At the end of the first 4&#x02009;weeks of the intervention, participants in groups 1 and 2 will attend a brief appointment (up to 1&#x02009;hour in duration). For group 1, the researcher will adjust settings to reveal physical activity feedback via the Fitbit application and device. For group 2, the researcher will install the LibreLink application to reveal glucose feedback. All participants will be able to access biobehavioural feedback for the remaining 2&#x02009;weeks of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s4b4"><title>Group 3 (biobehavioural feedback)</title><p>Participants in group 3 will receive biobehavioural feedback for the full 6&#x02009;weeks via the two independent LibreLink and Fitbit applications. Participants will install the LibreLink mobile application onto a personal Android smartphone to interact with the Freestyle Libre to measure interstitial glucose. The application will remind participants to scan every 7&#x02009;hours and to remove/replace the sensor after 14 days.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Final appointment</title><p>All participants (groups 1, 2 and 3) will be asked to attend the final appointment at the end of the intervention where they will complete a questionnaire (identical to appointment 2, apart from the revised Diabetes Knowledge Test) and a semistructured interview. All participants will also receive a personalised health report containing results from the health measures conducted at appointment one.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Device masking</title><p>All email accounts and password combinations will be manually generated and managed by the research team to prevent use of identifiable information. During baseline wear, the activity tracker will be physically masked using black tape applied to the screen; leaving only time and date viewable. Participants will be asked not to tamper with the screen; however, if they do manipulate the masking, it should be readily apparent to the research team. Settings on the application will also be adjusted to remove physical activity metrics from the device screen and notifications fully restricted on their phone and activity tracker. However, participants will not be locked out of the application due to the requirement to sync the device. Time spent on the Fitbit application will be inspected using Ethica Data (Kitchener, Ontario, Canada) to identify potential unauthorised use. The activity tracker will also be set to all-day sync to minimise data loss with data automatically transferred (Wi-Fi and Bluetooth must both be simultaneously switched on). When required to prevent access to glucose feedback, participants will wear the glucose sensors for 14-day period as normal but will not be asked to install the LibreLink application nor scan the sensor (ie, no data will be collected). This will standardise wear across all three groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Data management and storage procedures</title><p>All data collected will be anonymised by assigning a participant identification. Accounts with the three applications (Fitbit, LibreLink and Ethica Health) will be setup using study-specific (&#x02018;dummy&#x02019;) email addresses and passwords (accessible only to the research team) to minimise use of personalised information. All data will be stored securely on the Loughborough University server, as password-protected, encrypted documents and original paperwork kept in locked storage. No directly personally identifiable information will be collected through these platforms. Global positioning system&#x000a0;(GPS) will be collected via Ethica Data which could theoretically be &#x02018;reverse-engineered&#x02019; to reidentify individuals; however, all participants will be explicitly informed about all information monitored as part of the study. For individuals who do not wish to have their location services monitored, we will set up a &#x02018;reduced access&#x02019; version of Ethica Data (application usage, screen state and survey responses only).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Primary outcomes</title><sec id="s5a"><title>User engagement: Quantitative</title><p>Time spent on the official free Fitbit and LibreLink applications will be quantified using Ethica Data as well as time-stamped data relating to when the smartphone screen was turned on and off. In combination, these two data sources will reveal the proportion of time that the devices&#x02019; applications were used in relation to total smartphone use. These data will be recorded at either a day level (eg, aggregate time) or event level (eg, record of each time an application was opened) depending on the Android smartphone model. How often and how much time spent on the two applications compared with other applications on participants&#x02019; smartphones will also be quantified. Number of times the activity tracker syncs (occurs when the application is opened, assumed to see feedback about physical activity) and scans of the glucose sensor (occurs when the participant scans and to see feedback about interstitial glucose levels) will also be recorded. Compulsory engagement will be participants having to sync the activity tracker at least once every 5&#x02009;days and scan the glucose sensors at least once every 7&#x02009;hours. The number of syncs and scans recorded over and above compulsory engagement will reflect optional engagement. Identifying when and how often syncs and scans happen and how these patterns change over the course of the intervention (from week 1 to 6) will indicate engagement with the technology. We will also identify if participants change the goal settings relating to steps, floors climbed and active minutes on the Fitbit application. These settings will be checked daily between the hours of 18:00-19:00 by the research team and changes will be flagged with details of the original and new setting logged. In addition, assessing whether participants responded to prompts offered by the activity tracker will also be conducted (ie, did participants achieve 250 steps/hour? See Behaviour Change Techniques section for further detail).</p><p>Remote monitoring of participant glucose and physical activity will be completed using Diasend and Fitabase (Small Steps Labs LLC, San Diego, California,&#x000a0;USA), respectively. Diasend will connect with the Freestyle Libre via the LibreLink application and data will be recorded and accessed through this software. Additional data sources to be monitored by Ethica Data include battery status (ie, smartphone plugged in? Charging?), Bluetooth and Wi-Fi (turned on or off). Quantifying these data sources will provide valuable insight into participant behaviour (eg, Do participants only use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for the purpose of our intervention? Are participants charging it more often in the intervention compared with baseline?). Ethica Data will also monitor location (GPS), motion (pedometer, accelerometer, gravity, gyroscope, linear acceleration, magnetic field, orientation) and survey responses. These digital streams will monitor smartphone usage and will provide detailed data on human behaviour during a free-living, naturalistic setting. In total, 14&#x000a0;data sources will be monitored. In the event a participant raises concerns relating to the number and/or type of data sources being monitored, a restricted coverage option of only three data sources (application usage, screen state and survey responses) will be offered.</p></sec><sec id="s5b"><title>User engagement: qualitative</title><p>For participants who complete the 6-week intervention, a semistructured interview will be completed (20&#x02013;40&#x02009;min) during the final appointment at the National Centre for Sport and Exercise Medicine, Loughborough University, UK. The interview will aim to identify potential barriers and facilitators to using self-monitoring technologies. In particular, how participants experience receiving feedback relating to physical activity and interstitial glucose levels. These interviews will explore individual experiences using the device(s) and mobile application(s), adherence to syncing (Fitbit) and scanning (Freestyle Libre), wearing multiple devices and the perceived effect of viewing feedback on actual behaviour. In addition, participants will be asked about future intentions to continue wearing self-monitoring devices and identify any recommended changes for future study designs.</p><p>If a participant decides to withdraw from the study at any time prior to the final appointment, they will be able to leave the study via (1) the Ethica Health application on their personal smartphone (aligning with a dynamic consenting process<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) or by (2) contacting the research team via telephone or email. Participants that decide to withdraw via Ethica Health will be directed to complete a brief exit survey on the application.

The Fitbit records intensity (ie, minutes spent lightly active, fairly active and very active) in addition to heart rate and step count. Heart rate will be assessed using Fitbit&#x02019;s proprietary PurePulse optical heart rate technology. To examine changes in physical activity over the study duration, participants will be requested to wear the device for the full 7&#x02009;weeks and data will be analysed in 60&#x02009;s epochs following export from Fitabase. Previous models of the Fitbit have been validated for step count.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> A waking protocol will be implemented with non-wear defined as a loss of a heart rate signal.

Syncs beyond 7&#x02009;days will result in day level data rather than minute level data. These syncs will either occur automatically (ie, without the application open) or will be user&#x000a0;driven (ie, with the application open) depending on how the all-day sync is set and heart rate will be set to automatic (only record heart rate when device is worn).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s6c"><title>Interstitial glucose levels</title><sec id="s6c1"><title>Freestyle Libre</title><p>The minimally&#x000a0;invasive Freestyle Libre flash glucose monitor (Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, California,&#x000a0;USA) will be covered with Tegaderm (3M Health&#x000a0;Care, St Paul, Minnesotta,&#x000a0;USA) to help maintain position and adhesion during the 14-day sensor life&#x000a0;span. Three strips of Tegaderm will be provided to participants per sensor to allow for replacement when the Tegaderm becomes dirty.

Participants will be fully informed that they can freely change the goals set for physical activity as preferred (ie, should the default value be too easy/difficult) via the Fitbit application. However, participants will be advised to not make any changes via the LibreLink application for the target glucose range. Attainment of a goal will be assessed as either complete or incomplete. Participants will be asked to sync the Fitbit (at least once every 5&#x02009;days) and scan the Freestyle Libre (at least once every 7&#x02009;hours) if they are in the respective group to receive feedback from these devices.
