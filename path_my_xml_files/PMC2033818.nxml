A total of 234 eligible patients were randomised to receive an alternating schedule of PVB/BEP for a total of four cycles or four cycles of BEP. Poor prognosis was defined as any of the following: lymph node metastases larger than 5 cm, lung metastases more than four in number or larger than 2 cm, haematogenic spread outside the lungs, such as in liver and bone, human chorionic gonadotrophin &#x0003e; 10,000 IU l-1 or alphafetoprotein &#x0003e; 1000 IU l-1. The complete response (CR) rates to PVB/BEP and BEP were similar, 76% and 72% respectively (P = 0.58). In addition, there was no significant difference in relapse rate, disease-free and overall survival at an average follow-up of 6 years. The 5-year progression-free and survival rates in both treatment groups were approximately 80%. The PVB/BEP regime was more toxic with regard to bone marrow function; the frequencies of leucocytes below 1000 microliters-1, leucocytopenic fever and platelets below 25,000 microliters-1, throughout four cycles were 28% vs 5% (P &#x0003c; 0.001), 16% vs 5% (P = 0.006), and 10% vs 1% (P = 0.001) respectively. Neuropathy also occurred more often in the PVB/BEP arm: 47% vs 25% (P = 0.001). This study shows that an alternating regimen of PVB/BEP is not superior to BEP and that it is more myelo- and neurotoxic.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00052-0191.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1311" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00052-0192.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1312" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00052-0193.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1313" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00052-0194.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1314" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
