functional occlusion for the patient. To initiate the finishing stage of treatment,
teeth must be aligned, extraction spaces must be closed and posterior teeth must have a
Class I occlusal relationship. The finishing stage includes: obtain parallel roots,
adjust the position of individual teeth to correct mesiodistal and buccolingual
inclinations, and level marginal ridges by correction of bracket positions in order to
obtain an ideal occlusion.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">

</p><p>The outcomes of finished orthodontic treatments are assessed by employing different
criteria to express the quality of final results. In 1998, the American Board of
Orthodontics (ABO) introduced the Objective Grading System (OGS) or Cast/Radiographic
Evaluation (CRE), a standard method to evaluate finished cases considering eight
criteria (alignment, marginal ridges, buccolingual inclination, occlusal relationships,
occlusal contacts, overjet, interproximal contacts and root angulation) in dental casts
and panoramic radiographs.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">

</p><p>For the graduate program of Orthodontics at the Universidad de Antioquia, it is
important to have a tool to evaluate clinical processes and outcomes by means of a
system that provides reliable quantitative information, comparable to other similar
institutions. In the School of Dentistry of Universidad de Antioquia, during the years
of 2010-2011,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref> a total of 40 finished patients were evaluated by the Objective Grading System
(OGS). The average standard deviation score was: 31.7 &#x000b1; 8.4 points. This value is not
very high, considering that scores over 30 points are qualified as less than acceptable;
however, it is within the averages previously reported by other university orthodontic
programs.<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">

the ABO criteria.<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> At the University of Illinois, 92 finished cases were compared to 32 cases
treated by five orthodontists certified by the ABO. The OGS score was 45.54 &#x000b1; 18.3 for
university patients, significantly higher than the score obtained in private practice
(33.88 &#x000b1; 9.6).<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">

</p><p>At the Indiana University, based on the results measured by OGS criteria and the pattern
of deficiencies detected, a series of curricular changes was introduced with a view to
improving the efficiency of treatment. Following the introduction of those changes, the
Indiana University reported OGS indexes of 28.66 &#x000b1; 13.0 in 2001, 24.97 &#x000b1; 9.4 in 2002,

follow-up of cases, in addition to reducing patients' referrals. Due to these
modifications, the mean OGS changed from 28.55 &#x000b1; 1.7 in 2005 to 22.11 &#x000b1; 1.0 in

patients not following the finishing protocol. The inclusion criteria to select IG
patients were: </p><p>

</p><p>The exclusion criteria were patients who did not adhere to the protocol, and patients
who decided to remove the appliances at their own willing.</p><p>Due to ethical restriction for a random prospective distribution of patients into two
groups when a benefit from the intervention is theoretically expected, the Ethics Board
of the School of Dentistry suggested to apply the protocol to all patients treated
between 2014-2015 (IG), and use a historical group of patients finished between
2010-2011, when the finishing protocol was not applied, as a control group (CG). The
finishing protocol included the following activities:</p><p>

</p><p>The assessment of seven occlusal parameters<sup>4,12,13</sup> established by the OGS in
dental casts was digitally obtained by means of Ortho Insight 3D scanner (Motion View

manually assessed in the panoramic radiograph. The final OGS value was obtained by
adding the results of dental cast and radiographic measurements. The method described by
Barbosa et al<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study evaluated the outcomes obtained when a standardized finishing protocol was
applied to patients treated at the Orthodontics clinics of Universidad de Antioquia
during a period of 16 months, from 2014 to 2015. The results were evaluated according to
ABO-OGS criteria and compared with the results of a control group finished in 2010-2011,
when the protocol was not applied. The OGS scores are 38 &#x000b1; 9.01 and 31.41 &#x000b1; 9.67, for CG
and IG, respectively. This difference is statistically significant (Table 2). Therefore,
the application of the protocol contributed to the reduction in OGS mean value; however,
the total OGS score obtained is still high, as the ABO states that scores higher than 30
points are not acceptable.<sup>14</sup> The results of the present study are similar to
values reported by the Orthodontics program of the Indiana University, which revealed
some improvement after the introduction of corrective strategies. The percentage of
patients who finished with OGS values less than 30 points changed from 39.7% to
76.6%.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref> The present study shows that nearly half of patients treated according to the
finishing protocol achieved better outcomes according to international standards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig 1</xref>).</p><p>When specific components of the OGS, showing significant differences between groups,
were compared, it was observed that marginal ridge and root angulation are better for IG
than for CG (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). In other words, the OGS
component score was lower in IG compared to CG.</p><p>Poling<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref> recommends that, four to seven months before having orthodontic appliances
removed, the pa tient should be evaluated using a check-list ,in order to attain
excellent outcomes. The finishing protocol applied to the IG group was designed by the
authors, taking into account the ABO-OGS criteria and the evaluation of panoramic
radiographs as well as cast models of patients at the beginning of the finishing stage.
Before the introduction of the ABO-OGS system, orthodontists did not have a tool for
objective qualification of cases at the end of treatment, and that was one of the
reasons for not being approved by the ABO, since final occlusion was inadequate.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref> The control group was treated without having OGS parameters checked up; in
addition, casts and panoramic radiographs were frequently not taken into account to
finish the case. The case used to be considered as finished when only professors'
subjective criteria were followed. The results of the present study clearly in dicate
the importance of knowledge of ideal occlusion as well as the relevance of the
evaluation of clinical records taken for finishing stage. </p><p>The finishing guide appears to be necessary to identify and correct mistakes in dental
and root positions, so as to reduce the final OGS score.</p><p>The protocol implemented in the IG group, which is similar to that established by
Knierim et al,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref> suggests that, when it becomes necessary to correct tooth position, it is better
to reposition the bracket instead of introducing new arch bendings.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref> Other authors consider that bracket repositioning might not be correct,
perpetuating the error previously identified. When the <italic>UdeA Finishing
Guide</italic> was evaluated, it was observed that the most frequent strategy to
correct dental position was repositioning of brackets and tubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig 2</xref>). However, some components evaluated by the OGS did not
significantly improve. This finding suggests that some manipulations performed to
correct mistakes previously detected might not be adequate due to imprecision in the new
location of the bracket. It is also possible that, in some cases, the need for
correction was not detected. It was also observed that the intervention demanded for the
same tooth was, in some situations, a combination of bracket repositioning and new arch
bending, thereby suggesting that the strategy of repositioning may not be sufficient to
correct one or more errors in dental position.</p><p>The Discrepancy Index (DI) was developed by the ABO as an objective tool to describe
complexity of treatment, based upon observations and measurements taken in pretreatment
dental casts, cephalic and panoramic radiographs.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref> The lack of initial registers, standardized for both groups of patients,
precluded the application of DI to analyze its relationship with OGS. Instead, the grade
of commitment described by Barbosa et al<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref> was assessed, which appears to be related to OGS results. This indicates that
patients initiating orthodontic treatment with a high level of complexity tend to finish
it with higher OGS grades, and vice versa. The present study shows that highly
compromised patients finished treatment with a higher OGS score. However, the
correlation between OGS and grade of commitment was not statistically significant,
either due to sample size or lack of precision of the instrument used to evaluate
patients' commitment. </p><p>Pinskaya et al<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref> reported that longer treatment time is related to worse finishing results. In
the present study, there is no correlation between duration of treatment and OGS scores
in any group. This finding agrees with the study by Campbell et al.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref> The time of the finishing stage of treatment could not be compared between the
two groups due to lack of appropriate date records for the control group. However, total
treatment time was not significantly different between the two groups. Therefore, it is
apparent that the application of the finishing protocol improved clinical results
without increasing treatment time. </p><p>One possible limitation of this study is that the professors who performed the
supervision of the orthodontic treatment without finishing protocol four years before
may have improved their clinical skills since then, and this aspect could have affected
the final scores in the experimental group. However, one of the objectives of this trial
was to improve the knowledge and skills of professors. Apart from this aspect, the
improvement of the score should be attributed to the application of the whole protocol
as such, which had a training effect on all participants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The implementation of a standardized protocol for the finishing stage of orthodontic
treatments in the graduate clinics of Orthodontics of Universidad de Antioquia improved
