This study describes the use of intervention mapping (IM) in the design of a theory-driven, group-based complex intervention to support self-management (SM) of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and chronic low back pain (CLBP) in Ireland&#x02019;s primary care health system.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The six steps of the IM protocol were systematically applied to develop the self-management of osteoarthritis and low back pain through activity and skills (SOLAS) intervention through adaptation of the Facilitating Activity and Self-management in Arthritis (FASA) intervention. A needs assessment including literature reviews, interviews with patients and physiotherapists and resource evaluation was completed to identify the programme goals, determinants of SM behaviour, consolidated definition of SM and required adaptations to FASA to meet health service and patient needs and the evidence. The resultant SOLAS intervention behavioural outcomes, performance and change objectives were specified and practical application methods selected, followed by organised programme, adoption, implementation and evaluation plans underpinned by behaviour change theory.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The SOLAS intervention consists of six weekly sessions of 90-min education and exercise designed to increase participants&#x02019; physical activity level and use of evidence-based SM strategies (i.e. pain self-management, pain coping, healthy eating for weight management and specific exercise) through targeting of individual determinants of SM behaviour (knowledge, skills, self-efficacy, fear, catastrophizing, motivation, behavioural regulation), delivered by a trained physiotherapist to groups of up to eight individuals using a needs supportive interpersonal style based on self-determination theory. Strategies to support SOLAS intervention adoption and implementation included a consensus building workshop with physiotherapy stakeholders, development of a physiotherapist training programme and a pilot trial with physiotherapist and patient feedback.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">The SOLAS intervention is currently being evaluated in a cluster randomised controlled feasibility trial.

Contributing factors include variability in how SM is defined in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], the small effects for interventions in OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], the limited evidence base for effective interventions in CLBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] management and the diverse case mix of patients in primary care, which limits the time and expertise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] of physiotherapists tasked with developing such programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, the variable quality of Ireland&#x02019;s primary care health system infrastructure and staffing levels present further barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which taken together have contributed to a &#x02018;second translational gap&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">A systematic review of SM interventions for a range of chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions found that short (&#x0003c;8&#x000a0;weeks), healthcare professional-delivered, group interventions showed some positive effects, but further research of their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness was warranted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The successful implementation of a standardised, evidence-based clinical and cost-effective group programme to support SM for patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain is a key priority for primary care physiotherapy in Ireland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]; however, a potential intervention must first be demonstrated to be credible, feasible and implementable within this challenging health service context prior to widespread adoption.</p><p id="Par20">Complex interventions, for example, those designed to improve health outcomes by changing SM behaviour, contain several interacting components, as well as variability within the range of possible outcomes and number of behaviours required by those delivering and receiving the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. They typically include behavioural support to improve adherence to the desired behaviour and may target both modifications in healthcare provider behaviour relating to how they interact with patients in delivering the intervention and patient behaviour in adopting it. Moreover, the causal chain linking a behavioural support intervention to health outcomes is complex and requires a relevant theoretical model to understand its mechanisms of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This is further challenged by the demands associated with standardising the design and delivery of the intervention, sensitivity to local context, the organisational and logistical difficulties of applying standard experimental methods and the length and complexity of the causal chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Indeed, it has been acknowledged that ensuring strict standardisation may be inappropriate and the intervention may work better if a specified degree of adaptation to local settings is allowed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Nonetheless, a change in usual clinical practice is often required to ensure successful implementation, notwithstanding the additional complexity of delivering a group intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">The Medical Research Council (MRC) updated guidelines recommend an iterative, cyclical phased approach to intervention development and evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], noting that &#x02018;too strong an emphasis on the main evaluation to the neglect of adequate development and piloting or consideration of the practical issues of implementation will result in weaker interventions that are harder to evaluate, less likely to be implemented and less likely to be worth implementing&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Concern for implementation should begin in the design phase through consideration of the barriers and enablers to successful implementation and engagement of key stakeholders through involvement in the design and feasibility processes. The MRC framework provides a useful general approach to designing and evaluating complex interventions, but it does not provide detailed guidance on how to do this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. While the evaluation phase is widely reported with improving transparency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], there are few published examples of how the wider aspects of this framework are applied in practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Intervention mapping (IM) provides a logical process for intervention development, implementation and evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] that fulfils the MRC framework criteria and has been previously used to develop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and adapt evidence-based SM programmes for other settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The primary aims of this study were to use the IM process to develop a complex group-based SM intervention (SOLAS: self-management of osteoarthritis and low back pain through activity and skills) for Ireland&#x02019;s primary care physiotherapy service through adaptation of an existing evidence-based programme (Facilitating Activity and Self-management in Arthritis (FASA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]) which would serve as a prototype and to address factors related to its implementation in a planned feasibility trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] set in the publicly-funded Health Service Executive Primary Community and Continuing Care (PCCC) physiotherapy services of Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow on the east coast of Ireland serving a population of 1.6 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par22">IM is a six-step process with each step consisting of several tasks which once completed inform the next step as detailed in Bartholomew et al.

From the rapid review, the FASA intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] was selected as the prototype for adaptation that fulfilled our consolidated SM definition, being an education and exercise intervention based on the evidence-based ESCAPE programme for OA knee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], designed for people aged over 50&#x000a0;years with OA hip, knee and/or lumbar spine, which has been found to be clinically effective compared to standard general practitioner (GP) care (personal communications, N Walsh). FASA was designed to be delivered by one physiotherapist in groups of up to eight people and considered acceptable and feasible to support SM by healthcare professionals in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In the FASA trial, it was delivered by trained research physiotherapists in UK healthcare settings and had not been previously delivered by health service physiotherapists in any jurisdiction including Ireland. We contacted the FASA intervention developer (N Walsh) who agreed to collaborate, provided and discussed the intervention materials, and allowed our team to observe its delivery in several UK settings. From this, we believed it had the potential to meet our target population and health service needs but would need formal evaluation to establish if it was fit for purpose, acceptable to Irish primary care physiotherapists and required adaptation prior to evaluation in the planned feasibility trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par50">Within the most recent clinical guideline recommendations for OA and CLBP, the most consistent SM behaviours for programmes to promote/change within participants were a continuation or increase in physical activity, the use of joint specific exercise and pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain management approaches, with varying recommendations for healthy eating/weight management and pacing for OA and the use of active coping strategies for CLBP. The strategies that interventions should adopt to support SM behaviour ranged from none [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] to highly specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. An additional file provides details of these findings (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Three psychological factors that mediated (i.e. determinants) pain, disability and functional outcomes of interventions targeting these SM behaviours in chronic musculoskeletal pain were identified from the literature, i.e. increasing self-efficacy for OA and CLBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], and reducing pain catastrophizing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and fear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] for CLBP. The literature reviews of behaviour change theories and techniques found variable integration in included studies, with social cognitive theory being the most frequently applied, and identified the most commonly used BCTs in group-based SM programmes as outlined in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>.</p></list-item></list>

Opinions were mixed about the acceptability of including participants with CLBP, in addition to OA, and those below 50&#x000a0;years as within FASA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], but considered essential to recruiting sufficient patients to ensure the intervention&#x02019;s long-term viability. Physiotherapists were positive about the combined SM education and patient-led group exercise model of FASA, but felt 20&#x000a0;min was insufficient for education and discussion, 1&#x000a0;h was too short to run the group effectively, and two sessions per week as delivered in FASA while ideal was not acceptable from service or patient perspectives. An additional file provides further details of the feasibility analysis (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par53">The findings of the barriers and enablers analysis identified 13 of the 14 TDF domains and 30 themes that predominantly related to the physiotherapists (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;13) who would deliver the intervention, the target participants (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10), the intervention (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3), GPs (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2) and local organisations (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2). The majority of perceived barriers to delivering the intervention prototype were within the TDF environmental context and resources domain, beliefs about capabilities to deliver the intervention as intended and beliefs about its consequences. The key enablers were similar to the findings of the manager interviews. The significant influence of referring GPs as potential barriers and enablers to changing client attitudes, beliefs and expectations of the role of physiotherapy in promoting SM were also highlighted. From the participant perspective, the main barriers perceived by physiotherapists to be addressed were patients&#x02019; limited knowledge and skills in engaging in SM behaviours, particularly physical activity and exercise, low motivation to self-manage and regulate their behaviour and negative emotions about participating in a group.

The findings of the needs assessment informed several key decisions in designing the intervention. One, a number of determinants of the outcome of SM interventions in people with OA and CLBP identified from the literature (self-efficacy, motivation, catastrophizing, fear), focus groups (knowledge, skills, motivation, fear, behaviour-regulation) and expert consultation (behaviour regulation) were to be targeted within SOLAS (two of which were absent from FASA, i.e. catastrophizing, motivation; see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) as outlined in Fig <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Two, a specific behaviour change theory, self-determination theory (SDT), was selected to underpin participants&#x02019; uptake and engagement in the SOLAS intervention target behaviours as non-adherence to physical activity, exercise and diet is well recognised in the literature in these populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. SDT emphasises the importance of autonomy and autonomous self-regulation, core components of self-management behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. According to SDT, social agents such as healthcare practitioners can influence an individual&#x02019;s autonomous motivation for behaviour through their interpersonal style and interaction with the individual. A supportive interpersonal style satisfies an individual&#x02019;s psychological need for autonomy, competence and relatedness leading to increased levels of autonomous motivation for the behaviour. Previously, SDT has been successfully applied to group-based education, exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], weight management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], medication adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], diabetes SM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] and individual physiotherapy interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Several needs-supportive interpersonal strategies were identified from the literature to support physiotherapists&#x02019; effective delivery of the intervention using an SDT approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] that would be operationalised during the physiotherapist training programme (step 5); e.g. providing meaningful rationale for SM behaviours, acknowledging participants&#x02019; feelings and perspectives and offering opportunities for participant input. Three, although the intervention prototype was found to be broadly consistent with current guidelines for OA, the SOLAS intervention would address the need for more evidence-based information on healthy weight, nutraceuticals and acupuncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Four, as FASA was not designed for non-specific CLBP, additional education content on the nature of CLBP, active coping strategies and current recommendations for acupuncture and TENS were needed. Finally, the education content required adaptation to reflect socio-demographic statistics related to physical activity, obesity, OA and LBP within the Irish population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].

A cluster randomised trial design was chosen to avoid contamination of the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The most appropriate comparison was considered usual treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], defined as individual physiotherapy care. The trial aims to assess the acceptability and demand of the SOLAS intervention to patients and physiotherapists compared to usual treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], the feasibility of trial procedures and the most efficient and effective study design for a definitive trial. In the absence of a suitable validated SM outcome measure from the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], a new measure was developed for evaluation within the feasibility trial. A range of effect and mediation outcome measures were selected from the literature to be evaluated within the trial. A detailed fidelity protocol has been developed and published separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. The pilot trial resulted in further minor adaptations to the intervention content and materials, enhanced physiotherapist training from 1.5 to 2&#x000a0;days (more emphasis on goal setting, problem solving, and feedback) and amended participant eligibility criteria (CLBP participants age &#x02264;30&#x000a0;years) prior to commencement of the main feasibility trial in September 2014.</p></list-item></list>

</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par72">This study provides a detailed example of the systematic application of the IM protocol to develop the SOLAS theory-driven evidence-based group intervention to promote self-management in people with OA hip/knee and/or CLBP through adaptation of an existing evidence-based programme. There is currently limited literature on the detailed reporting of the critical development phase of complex interventions in primary healthcare and the application of IM in chronic musculoskeletal pain or physiotherapy, and this study should inform future researchers in this evolving field. We followed all the recommended steps within IM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], engaged a representative sample of stakeholders using a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, applied emerging behaviour change methodologies to inform SOLAS intervention development and implementation and adhered to TIDieR guidance in its description [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. We believe that the decision to adapt an existing intervention enhanced its uptake by stakeholders, the quality of the intervention and materials and allowed the intervention development group to address the practicalities of implementation, including physiotherapist training from the outset.</p><p id="Par73">The SOLAS intervention provides for the first time a group intervention for people with two of the most common chronic musculoskeletal conditions (i.e. OA and CLBP) presenting to primary care. While the multi-joint aspect of the FASA prototype for people with OA aged over 50&#x000a0;years was acceptable to UK physiotherapists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], and credible to Ireland&#x02019;s stakeholder primary care physiotherapists, it was considered necessary to adapt the diagnostic pool for SOLAS to include people with non-specific CLBP aged at least 30&#x000a0;years to increase its acceptability to meet their service needs. Further adaptations were required to implement recent clinical guideline recommendations for OA and CLBP and Irish sociodemographic statistics. Finally, the overall structure of the programme was adapted from 12 twice weekly, 1-h sessions to 6 once weekly, 90-min sessions despite some patients and physiotherapists expressing support for a longer programme. Nonetheless, the majority of physiotherapists believed that 6&#x000a0;weeks reflected current practice and was more realistic for patients, which is supported by a recent systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. However, it has been proposed that longer programmes may provide larger treatment effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>], which could be considered worthwhile by patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Similarly, the decision to deliver the intervention once rather than the more frequent twice weekly reported in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>] was taken to enhance acceptability to local physiotherapist stakeholders as demonstrated in a quote from one focus group participant &#x02018;twice a week is&#x02026;a nice idea. What you use in trials and then never use in practice&#x02019;. The feasibility trial results will inform whether these decisions were correct and reflect the reality of collaborating with healthcare professional stakeholders in developing interventions while also taking account of the evidence. If positive, this pragmatic example of involving clinicians has the potential to enhance future knowledge translation of evidence-based interventions, which is highly variable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and potentially hampered by previously prioritising the role of clinicians as intervention deliverers to the detriment of harnessing their invaluable contribution in the design phase. Using the IM process to also understand and address the barriers to recruiting and retaining sufficient participants, the identification of sufficient numbers of suitable clinical sites, required adaptations to facilities, equipment and staffing and training requirements to support consistent intervention delivery across a range of primary care health settings enhanced our readiness to evaluate the intervention in the feasibility trial.</p><p id="Par74">As demonstrated in this paper, the IM process details how accessing and using theory can be undertaken to support intervention development and implementation as highlighted in the MRC framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The application of this approach allows for meaningful analysis of the underlying mechanisms that are hypothesised to affect the desired intervention outcomes, by enabling the explicit linking of intervention components to theory, which should lead to improved outcomes for the targeted populations and an enhanced potential for intervention replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Our rapid review found that the majority of previous group-based SM interventions failed to report any underpinning behaviour change theory or techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], reducing understanding of mechanisms of action, preventing replication and potentially contributing to their small effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. This was compounded by the limited and variable quality of mediation studies for the target SM behaviours in OA and CLBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>] that required our pragmatic selection of behavioural determinants that could be targeted by the intervention. While self efficacy is an important determinant of physical activity in the general population and older adults with some evidence in OA and CLBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], the more tenuous evidence for the effects of fear and catastrophizing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] on SM outcomes warrants further investigation in appropriately designed and powered prospective mediation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Motivation was identified as a key determinant of SM behaviour and enhanced within the intervention by selecting SDT rather than other theoretical perspectives due its primary focus on an individual&#x02019;s need for autonomy, a core component of SM. Other prominent psychological theories identified in our literature review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>], such as social cognitive theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] (which was applied within FASA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]), predominantly target constructs such as self efficacy, conceptually similar to competence within SDT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>], rather than autonomy. It was also considered unnecessary to include an additional behaviour change theory to target some of the other determinants, as SDT has been found to positively influence other mediators (i.e. fear) related to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>], and the TDF provides a sound theoretical basis for targeting all our selected mediators. Furthermore, the evidence for the determinants of increasing participants&#x02019; SM knowledge and skills exemplified in our consolidated definition and highlighted in the physiotherapist focus groups was limited by their poor measurement in previous studies that should be addressed in future research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>].</p><p id="Par75">The study is limited by comparatively less engagement with people with OA and CLBP in the intervention development process that may have increased the acceptability and sustainability of the intervention, but will be addressed in the feasibility trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. While it would have been preferable to specify the target behaviours in a more detailed way, most current OA and CLBP guidelines lack specificity in relation to physical activity and dietary changes for weight management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. Indeed, recent evidence has reported health gains in those achieving below recommended physical activity levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>], and there is general consensus that due to concerns about pain exacerbation, people with chronic musculoskeletal pain should be supported to do activity according to their abilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>], as we have previously demonstrated in CLBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Nonetheless, the intervention included public health recommendations for 150&#x000a0;min of moderate intensity physical activity, as well as healthy eating and weight management guidance in addition to relevant statistics for the Irish population to promote behaviour change. While recommendations for resistance and flexibility exercises on 2 or 3&#x000a0;days each week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>] were conveyed to participants during SOLAS, they could have been specified more explicitly within the target behaviours without undermining autonomous motivation. In relation to the remaining SM behaviours, recent trials reporting positive effects have failed to quantify the use of pain coping skills, pharmacological or non-pharmacological pain management strategies by participants, thus limiting our ability to specify targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. Within the feasibility trial, the proportion of participants achieving recommended levels of physical activity and using the SM behaviours will be explored to allow their specification for a future definitive trial. Finally, potential socio-cultural and environmental determinants of physical activity and diet in the general population were not specifically addressed within our intervention due to lack of evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par76">This study provides a detailed example of the application of the IM approach to the development of a theory-driven, group-based complex intervention designed to promote self-management, for evaluation in a feasibility trial.
