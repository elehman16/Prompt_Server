The 4 arms were (I) formulation B, 2 t.i.d.; (II) formulation B, 2 q.i.d.; (III) platform combination+Sallaki Guggul; (IV) Bhallataka Parpati+formulation C. A detailed enquiry was carried out for adverse events (AE) and drug toxicity as per a priori check list and volunteered information.

Ayurveda has a tremendous potential to offer safer therapies for difficult to treat disorders such as arthritis. OA is a common disabling community ailment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Several Ayurvedic medicinal plants used to treat arthritis in clinical practice demonstrated significant biological and immunomodulation effects in clinical drug trials[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] and experimental studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] As part of a Government &#x0201c;New Millennium Indian Technology Leadership Initiative&#x0201d; (NMITLI), we carried out several clinical and experimental investigational studies to develop and evaluate candidate Ayurvedic drugs to treat OA knees. Our mandate was to validate an effective and safe drug for global use.</p><p>The results of the first exploratory randomized double-blind placebo and active comparator (glucosamine) controlled drug trial to evaluate 5 selected Ayurvedic herbal formulations under the NMITLI project were recently published.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] The Ayurvedic formulations contained Shunthi (<italic>Zingiber officinale</italic>)&#x02014;Guduchi (<italic>Tinospora cordifolia</italic>) extracts base; other extracts chosen and added were Ashwagandha (<italic>Withania somnifera</italic>), Amalaki (<italic>Emblica officinalis</italic>), and Gokshur (<italic>Tribulus terrestris</italic>). The formulations were administered in doses that were considered adequate by Ayurvedic experts and investigators. Although statistically significant efficacy in reducing pain (primary efficacy) as compared with placebo was not demonstrated, coded formulations &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; (Shunthi&#x02013;Guduchi&#x02013;Amalaki) and &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; (Shunthi&#x02013;Guduchi&#x02013;Ashwagandha&#x02013;Gokshur) were found numerically superior for several efficacy and overall safety measures as compared with placebo and glucosamine and chosen for further validation.</p><p>In retrospect, on critical appraisal of the first study (mentioned above) we identified two principal areas for further investigation. Firstly, how safe (and effective) would be an increased optimum dose of C and B formulations? Secondly, what would be the effect of adding Sallaki Guggul (gum extract of <italic>Boswellia species</italic>) and Bhallataka Parpati (a traditional preparation of <italic>S. anacardium</italic> oil) to the selected formulations? The clinical use and experimental validation of Sallaki Guggul and Bhallataka as <italic>Rasayana</italic> with potent anti-inflammatory and antiarthritis properties is well documented[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] and both were among the short listed medicinal plants for this project. This report presents results of this short-term dosing and combination study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Design</title><p>Ninety-two patients of symptomatic OA knees were enrolled in a randomized, investigator blind, parallel efficacy drug trial of 6 weeks duration using 4 intervention treatment arms. Two rheumatology centers participated in the study, 68 and 24 patients, respectively, were recruited in the Centre for Rheumatic Diseases, Pune, and Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad. The protocol was approved by the respective institutional ethics committees. We followed the trial methodology (including patient selection, inclusion, and exclusion criteria, efficacy measures, safety evaluation and statistics, Ayurvedic plant standardization and manufacture, animal toxicity studies) used in the first NMITLI trial.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Prior to signing the informed consent, the patients were properly informed and counseled. However, some important variations and features of this trial are described.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Ayurvedic formulations</title><p>The description of the ingredients, rationale, and pharmacologic properties (including Ayurvedic), standardization and manufacture of &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; formulations were recently published.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Extracts of Sallaki Guggul and Bhallataka Parpati were new additions and were individually manufactured as per Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia and GMP guidelines and standards.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> describes the compositions and dosing in each of the 4 intervention arms (Group I, II, III, and IV). All the primary formulations in each of the intervention arm had a core composition of Shunthi and Guduchi. The core composition per se and coded as &#x0201c;SG&#x0201d; was used in Group III intervention group. Patients in groups III and IV were also treated with Sallaki Guggul and Bhallataka Parpati, respectively. In brief, the daily dosage of Shunthi, Guduchi, Ashwagandha, and Amalaki, in the current study [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>] was 1.5&#x02013;2 times higher than that used in the earlier trial.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Shunthi was used as powder. Bhallataka Parpati is a popular traditional preparation of Vaidya Yashwant Govind Joshi, a senior Ayurvedic Practitioner in Pune, used to treat arthritis and allegedly considered to be safer than some of the classical Bhallataka preparations. Vaidya Joshi supervised the current study preparation, which essentially was an oil extract of Bhallataka treated with a resin of a medicinal plant called <italic>Shorea robusta</italic> in a systematic process to yield a dry powder (called <italic>Parpati</italic> in Ayurveda). Guduchi, Ashwagandha, Gokshur, and Amalaki were used in form of aqueous extracts.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Formulations used in each of the intervention arms</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JAIM-3-38-g001"/></table-wrap><p>The development, standardization, and manufacture of Ayurvedic formulations were same as earlier trial.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>Ayurvedic experts of NMITLI project finalized the optimum doses and combinations based on personal experience, classic texts and pharmacopoeia, and consensus.</p><p>All trial material was procured and appropriately coded by Interdisciplinary School of Health Sciences under the direct supervision of senior investigator who was not part of the clinical team (BP).

The AE were uniformly mild and managed with standard Ayurvedic advice and did not cause any patient to withdraw during the 6-week study period. None of the patients in the current study suffered a serious AE. None of the patients consumed any analgesic during the study period.</p><p>The high doses of Shunthi&#x02013;Guduchi formulations in the current study [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>] were guided by classical Ayurvedic texts but finalized through consensus of Ayurvedic experts and study investigators. It was decided to evaluate 2 higher dose regimen of &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; formulation (Group I and II) because of some discrepancy in the experts&#x02019; opinion. Similarly, a higher dose of SG core platform formulation (group III) and &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; (group IV) was used in groups III and IV. Higher doses did not produce increased AE. An increased frequency of mild constipation was reported with the higher dose of &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>]. It is also interesting to note that in sharp contrast to the lesser dose, a higher dose of &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; did not result in a worsened overall AE profile [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>] but also failed to show better improvement in pain or WOMAC scores [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>].</p><p>The nature of AE were mostly related to gut and ranged from mild dyspeptic symptoms to epigastric pain and burning. The number of patients and individual AE in each of the intervention arms was much less than that observed with corresponding intervention groups at eight week study period in the earlier trial.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Interestingly, two patients in intervention group IV [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>] who were treated with a Shunthi&#x02013;Guduchi&#x02013;Amalaki formulation along with Bhallataka Parpati showed mild elevation of hepatic SGPT. We could not find a similar elevation of serum liver enzyme, especially with reference to corresponding formulation, during a review of the earlier trial[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] laboratory data. However, in our earlier study on classical Bhallatak formulation &#x0201c;Amrut Bhallatak,&#x0201d; we found elevation of liver enzymes (SGOT and SGPT) in 3 out of 45 patients treated for 6 weeks in incremental higher doses.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>We have also used Bhallataka Parpati as a monotherapy to treat rheumatoid arthritis in a 6-month controlled drug trial but did not observe elevation in serum liver enzymes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Bhallataka is a popular Ayurvedic medicinal plant used in several classical formulations and well known to cause severe hypersensitivity and toxicity, especially that of skin, mucosa, gut, and liver. Bhallatak is used very cautiously in Ayurvedic practice due to its known toxicity and hypersensitivity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] The mild hepatic AE in the current study may be due to a high dose of Shunthi&#x02013;Guduchi&#x02013;Amalaki formulation administered along with Bhallataka Parpati. The latter needs further investigation.</p><p>Although safety was the prime concern of the current study, it was reassuring to note improved efficacy in Group IV. Rescue medication was not allowed in the current study. It is against this background that the results shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref> assume significance. Patients with moderately severe chronic OA knees and a high extent of active pain VAS at baseline were enrolled into the current study [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Chondroprotection is a laudable objective for any long-term medication in chronic OA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] However, it is &#x0201c;pain&#x0201d; that encourages a patient of OA knees to seek quick relief, and modern medicines score high in this regard. The earlier NMITLI drug trial study allowed paracetamol as a rescue medication and demonstrated a fair degree of reduced consumption.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] In the current study of 6 weeks duration, using higher doses of formulations selected from the latter trial, we could manage without the rescue paracetamol and demonstrate fair&#x02013;good pain relief [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>]. The addition of Bhallataka Parpati seems to have also contributed to improved pain relief. The pain relief in Group III with the addition of Sallaki Guggul was surprisingly modest despite a numerically best reduction in WOMAC difficulty. However, OA is a chronic disorder and a long-term relief would be more meaningful. Several laboratory markers (hyaluronic acid, cytokines, and C-TAX II) of efficacy were investigated in the current study but consistent results were only demonstrated with the urinary C-TAX II assay. It is interesting to note that although there were no significant differences, all the intervention groups showed reduction in urinary C-TAX [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] with an impressive reduction seen in group IV. The latter paved way for further validation of Shunthi&#x02013;Guduchi formulations and Sallaki Guggul in particular.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Urinary CTX II (C-Telopeptide Fragments of Collagen Type II) assay (median, ng/mL) as per the intervention arms</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JAIM-3-38-g006"/></fig><p>There are several limitations in this study. The treatment of disease in Ayurveda is holistic and tailored to an individual and we have only focused on formulations. The sample size was small and the duration of the study short. Bhallataka parpati is strictly not a classic text book Ayurvedic formulation but was chosen because of its popular use by a renowned Ayurvedic physician. Safety and tolerability is a fundamental advantage with Ayurvedic medicines and difficult to capture totally in a trial setting.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated an impressive safety profile of Shunthi&#x02013;Guduchi formulations in the treatment of OA knees despite increased optimized doses and over and above that used in an earlier NMITLI drug trial.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Although not a primary objective, the increased dose use of Shunthi&#x02013;Guduchi-based formulation, in particular when combined with Amalaki, and administered in combination with Bhallataka parpati also seems to improve efficacy (pain relief). Addition of Sallaki Guggul also seems to have improved efficacy without increasing the adverse event profile. Finally, in conjunction with the previously published NMITLI trial,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] we strive to demonstrate the NMITLI model for a rapid (and possibly economical) and scientifically appealing clinical development of Ayurvedic formulations in chronic disorders, such as OA. The results of the current study were used to design a statistically powered drug trial for the final evaluation of Shunthi-Guduchi&#x02013;based formulations in the treatment of OA knees.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTION</title><p>The protocol was principally designed by AC with important inputs from GT and MS. The laboratory investigations were supervised and carried out by AV. GT and BP were largely responsible for finalizing all aspects of the Ayurvedic formulations. The trial was co-ordinated by MS. Statistical analysis was carried out by SS. This manuscript was prepared by AC, GT, and MS and all the authors vouch for its correctness and veracity. As chair of the NMITLI arthritis project, BP was responsible for its concept, rationale, and plan.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This study was funded by the NMITLI cell, TNBD Division of the CSIR, Government of India.
