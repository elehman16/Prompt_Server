There is an increasing interest in the use of mindfulness-related interventions in the management of patients with a chronic disease. In addition, interventions that promote personal control, stress-management and other lifestyle factors, such as diet and exercise, assist in reducing disability and improving quality of life in people with chronic illnesses. There has been little research in this area for people with PD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A prospective mixed-method randomised clinical trial involving community living adults with PD aged &#x0003c;76&#x02005;years and with moderate disease severity (Hoehn and Yahr stage 2) PD. Participants will be randomised into the ESSENCE 6-week programme or a matched wait list control group. ESSENCE is a multifaceted, healthy lifestyle and mindfulness programme designed to improve quality of life. We aim to determine whether participation in a mindfulness and lifestyle programme could improve PD-related function and explore self-management related experiences and changing attitudes towards self-management. The outcome measures will include 5 self-administered questionnaires: PD function and well-being questionnaire (PDQ39), Health Behaviours, Mental health, Multidimensional locus of control, and Freiburg mindfulness inventory. An embedded qualitative protocol will include in-depth interviews with 12 participants before and after participation in the 6-week programme and a researcher will observe the programme and take notes.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis</title><p>Repeated measures of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) will examine the outcome measures for any significant effects from the group allocation, age, sex, adherence score and attendance. Qualitative data will be analysed thematically. We will outline the benefits of, and barriers to, the uptake of the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>This protocol has received ethics approval from the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee project number CF11/2662&#x02013;2011001553.</p></sec><sec><title>Dissemination</title><p>This is the first research of its kind in Australia involving a comprehensive, lifestyle-based programme for people with PD and has the potential to involve a broader range of providers than standard care.

These suburbs are separated by the central business district and are approximately 20&#x02005;km apart. The venue at each location will be an easily accessible, local community centre. Both venues will be located close to an existing large PD support group.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Formation of advisory group</title><p>An expert advisory group will be formed for the purpose of the study to advise on recruitment, link clinicians and researchers and provide comment to maintain relevance of the research. The advisory group will meet three times during the 12-month project period. Members of the advisory group will consist of health professionals with an interest in PD, two people living with PD and the research team. The health professionals include two neurologists, two health psychologists, one occupational therapist, one representative from the state support and funding body <italic>Parkinson's Victoria (PV)</italic> and another from the state PD registry (Victorian Parkinson's registry). Apart from contributions to the advisory committee, the funder will have no role in decisions and procedures concerning data collection, analysis, interpretation and academic dissemination.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Participants</title><p>The &#x02018;test&#x02019; group are to be participants attending the first 6-week ESSENCE programme at each location. The controls will be those in each waitlist group. All the control participants will be invited to attend a second ESSENCE programme held at each site, which starts after the test groups have completed the programme. An initial study eligibility criterion for participants was 18&#x02013;70&#x02005;years of age. This was reviewed by the advisory group and changed to include participants up to 75&#x02005;years of age in order to maximise recruitment reach and improve study power.</p><p>The eligibility criteria are

Target participants will initially be invited to participate through a combination of written invitations from Parkinson&#x02019;s Victoria to those listed on the Parkinson's registry, advertisements in Parkinson&#x02019;s Victoria publications (written and electronic) and invitations disseminated to clinicians dealing with patients with PD. As highlighted from a number of previous studies within the Parkinson's community, recruitment within this population is significantly slower than most other chronic disease populations resulting in low study participant numbers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> In order to address this potential barrier to our study, a recruitment officer will be employed. The recruitment officer will assist the advisory board in developing additional recruitment strategies.</p><p>Such additional strategies to be considered mirror those addressed by the Michael J. Fox Foundation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> These will include the development of promotional study materials including posters, flyers delivered to the Melbourne-based community and health services, engaging with Parkinson's support groups, presenting at major Parkinson's Victoria events including the Parkinson's &#x02018;Walk in the Park&#x02019; and Young at Parkinson's annual meeting, utilising existing recruitment registries such as the Michael.

The programme introduces simple strategies that can help participants to live better with chronic disease. Participants will be encouraged to apply aspects of the ESSENCE model that are most relevant to them in their own lives. Mindfulness training and group support, provided by the regular, weekly sessions involving other people at a similar stage of progression of PD, are part of the programme to provide benefit in their own right as well as to facilitate healthy lifestyle change.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2013003326F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>The ESSENCE acronym.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2013003326f01"/></fig><p>The programme will be facilitated by the creator of the ESSENCE model and General Practitioner (CH) whose role is to run the programme and not to intervene in the medical management of the participants&#x02019; PD.

The group will also provide advice on additional dissemination methods to make the greatest impact within the study field. The study findings will be made accessible to people with PD within Victoria, and potentially throughout Australia, through project updates and outputs placed on websites and newsletters of the advisory group forums and funding body Parkinson's Victoria. With the academic expertise of the investigators, study findings will also be disseminated through academic outlets including journal publications, national and international conferences and peer-reviewed forums.</p><p>A potential ethical issue of consideration in this study may arise if any study participant is identified as having significant depression as indicated by the DASS21<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> (collected at baseline, week 7 and again at 6&#x02005;months). The MUHREC was consulted about this possible scenario. They advised that such patients could participate in the programme providing that a clinical researcher associated with the project confidentially discusses the abnormal depression scores with the participant and recommend that they see their general practitioner. This minimal follow-up was deemed as appropriate because the programme intervention is unlikely to cause harm particularly in light of the participants only practicing mindfulness-based strategies and making lifestyle changes according to their own motivation and choice.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the MUHREC Project number CF11/2662&#x02013;2011001553. Data will be securely stored for 5&#x02005;years in accordance with MUHREC guidelines. The trial was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Register (ACTRN12612000440820) on 18/04/2012.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The last decade has seen an explosion in the trialling of mindfulness-based interventions in the management of chronic disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
