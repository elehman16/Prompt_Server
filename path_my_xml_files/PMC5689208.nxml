TGF-&#x003b2; stimulates proteoglycan synthesis and chondrocyte proliferation, and may also have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A new treatment approach for knee osteoarthritis (OA) involves intraarticular administration of human chondrocytes transduced with a viral vector containing the gene for TGF-&#x003b2;1 transcription. Recently, a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of non-transduced allogeneic human chondrocytes and allogeneic human chondrocytes virally transduced to express TGF-&#x003b2;1 (TG-C) was done. TG-C is made of human chondrocytes which has immunosuppressive effect and is grown from tissue obtained from a polydactyly finger of a single infant donor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. TG-C represents a cell-mediated cytokine gene therapy approach for local intra-articular administration in patients with OA. TG-C showed positive effects on pain levels in patients with moderate to advanced knee OA, as demonstrated by the visual analogue scale (VAS) and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores at 1&#x000a0;year follow-up compared to the control cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Patients receiving TG-C had less knee pain, and they were less likely to need analgesics compared to placebo. However, effects of TG-C on MRI-assessed structural changes in knee joint tissues have only been assessed in a single study demonstrating mixed results after 12&#x000a0;months, i.e. those who received low-dose TG-C showed worsening mean MRI score of cartilage signal intensity, while those who had high-dose TG-C showed worsening mean MRI scores in bone surface osteophytes and periarticular inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Our study aimed to assess effects of intraarticular TG-C on structural progression of knee OA features based on semi-quantitative MRI evaluation compared with placebo during 12-months of follow-up period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subject inclusion and exclusion</title><p id="Par19">Our study was a multi-center double-blind placebo-controlled phase II randomized clinical trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: NCT01221441.Registered 13th October, 2010).

</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par32">In our phase II trial of allogeneic human chondrocytes expressing TGF-&#x003b2;1 (TG-C) vs. placebo in patients with moderate to advanced OA, a lower proportion of knees showed progression of cartilage damage on a knee level as well as less progression of MRI-based inflammatory markers for the treatment group compared to placebo. No preventive effect in regard to potential hypertrophic osteophyte formation was observed for the treatment group compared to placebo. Likewise, no significant differences between treatment and placebo were seen for change in BML and meniscal damage.</p><p id="Par33">Previously, safety and tolerability of TG-C was demonstrated in a phase I human study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. More recently, positive effects of TG-C on knee function and pain in patients with moderate to advanced knee osteoarthritis were reported, showing some improvement in knee pain, function, and physical ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In these studies, however, MRI-based &#x02013;structural assessment was not included.</p><p id="Par34">MRI has become an essential research tool for knee OA studies thanks to its ability to non-invasively visualize the morphology of different knee joint tissues relevant to the disease process, and especially hyaline cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Potential beneficial effects of TG-C on cartilage formation/growth for treatment of articular cartilage defects was first reported by Noh and colleagues in preclinical studies using mice, rabbits and goats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In these animal studies, cartilage status after treatment was evaluated histologically at autopsy. Such an outcome measure is not appropriate in a phase II human study and therefore we deployed MRI which is a non-invasive imaging method.</p><p id="Par35">Cho and colleagues reported a Korean phase IIa clinical trial in which MRI was used to evaluate effects of TG-C on structural changes including BMLs, cartilage damage, osteophytes, meniscal damage, effusion and periarticular inflammation 6-months and 12-months after TG-C injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In this study, effects of TG-C on MRI-based structural outcomes (assessed using the WORMS) were variable depending on TG-C dosage (low vs. high) and length of observation (6&#x000a0;months vs. 12&#x000a0;months). At 6&#x000a0;months, the low-dose cohort demonstrated worsening in mean MRI scores in one parameter (osteophytes), while the high-dose cohort demonstrated no worsening in mean scores. At 12&#x000a0;months, the low-dose cohort had worsening in the mean score in a subset of one parameter of unknown clinical significance, i.e. cartilage signal intensity, and the high-dose cohort demonstrated worsening in mean scores in two parameters (osteophytes and periarticular inflammation). This study was limited by a small number of subjects (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;27), relatively short follow-up time and lack of a placebo group. The US phase II study described herein had more than double the sample size, had a placebo group, and deployed a more detailed outcome analyses.</p><p id="Par36">Despite the fact that TGF-&#x003b2;1 is understood to be an anabolic agent, our study did not show any preventive effect of TG-C on progression of osteophyte formation in kneeOA. In fact, failing to reach statistical significance in all of our analyses may partly be due to sample size and low rates of progression overall. Also, since OA is a slowly progressing disease, a follow-up period of 12&#x000a0;months may have been too short to observe statistically significant effects of the TGF-&#x003b2;1 on structural progression of knee OA. Therefore, a future study with a larger number of subjects and a longer period of follow-up is necessary to confirm our preliminary observation regarding the effects of TGF-&#x003b2;1 on structural progression of knee OA. However, based on our results and thus far available literature evidence from animal and human studies, continued research efforts utilizing MRI-based structural outcomes to assess clinical efficacy of TG-C seem justifiable, especially focusing on cartilage regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par37">In conclusion, intraarticular treatment with TG-C may potentially show benefits on delayed progression of cartilage damage and MRI markers of inflammation in osteoarthritis with fewer patients in the treated group showing progression of these structural OA features. However, TG-C showed no preventive effect for progression of BMLs and meniscal damage, or hypertrophic osteophyte formation within 12&#x000a0;month follow-up.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p id="Par5">Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BML</term><def><p id="Par6">Bone marrow lesion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIV</term><def><p id="Par7">Human immunodeficiency virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IKDC</term><def><p id="Par8">International Knee Documentation Committee</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRI</term><def><p id="Par9">Magnetic resonance imaging</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OA</term><def><p id="Par10">Osteoarthritis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TE</term><def><p id="Par11">Time to echo</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TG-C</term><def><p id="Par12">Allogeneic human chondrocytes expressing TGF-&#x003b2;1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TGF</term><def><p id="Par13">Transforming growth factor beta 1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TR</term><def><p id="Par14">Time to repetition</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p id="Par15">Visual analogue scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WORMS</term><def><p id="Par16">Whole Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank the participants and staff of our clinical trial especially all principal investigators from:</p><p>Michael Mont, MD.</p><p>Rubin Institute for Advanced Orthopedics.</p><p>Center for Joint Preservation and Reconstruction, Baltimore, MD.</p><p>David Romness, MD.</p><p>Commonwealth Orthopedics, Arlington, VA.</p><p>Javad Parvizi, MD.</p><p>The Rothman Institute, Philadelphia, PA.</p><p>Dale Bramlet, MD.</p><p>Advent Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation LLC, Pinellas Park, FL.</p><p>Kenneth Cherry, MD.</p><p>University Orthopedics Center, State College, PA.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par38">There were no research grants for this study.
