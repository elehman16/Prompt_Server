All subjects who were randomized were considered for safety analysis. Missing values were dealt with by the last observation carried forward strategy. Parametric tests were used for comparison of normally distributed numerical variables. Categorical data were compared between groups by Chi-squared test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, as appropriate. Repeated measure non-parametric data within group analysis was done by Friedman&#x02019;s analysis of variance (ANOVA) and between group analysis was done by Mann Whitney U test.</p><p>Out of 62 subjects screened, 52 fulfilled the selection criteria and were randomized &#x02013; 26 to group A (gemifloxacin) arm and 26 to group B (cefpodoxime).

The protocol specified sample size of 26 &#x0201c;evaluable&#x0201d; subjects could be achieved in group A only within the study period. The mean age of patients was 59.6 &#x000b1; 6.7 years and 59.2 &#x000b1; 8.5 years in the gemifloxacin and cefpodoxime groups, respectively. 80.7% were males in the gemifloxacin group and 87.5% were males in the other group.

Within group analysis of changes in baseline versus first, second follow-up and the study end scores showed a highly significant reduction in both the groups (<italic>P</italic> values included in table), denoting that there was a clinically significant improvement in the signs and symptoms of the acute exacerbation episode of the disease. Therefore, it can be concluded that both gemifloxacin and cefpodoxime are effective antibiotics for the management of AECB. A between group analysis of the symptom scores showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the baseline, first follow-up and end of study scores in the respiratory symptom score. A statistically significant difference was noted in the second follow-up visit (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04). Since in majority of the visits there was no difference, it can be concluded that both gemifloxacin and cefpodoxime are equally effective antibiotics for the management of AECB.</p><table-wrap id="T0002" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Within group comparison of respiratory symptom scores</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Visit</italic></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Group A (gemifloxacin) (n = 26)</italic></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Group B (cefpodoxime) (n = 24)</italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Baseline score</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Mean &#x000b1;

Only five AEs were noted during the entire study period - three AEs in cefpodoxime group, which were mild diarrhea, and two AEs in gemifloxacin group, one case each of rash and dizziness. These AEs were non-serious and mild in nature and did not require any dose reduction or withdrawal of the study medications. Causality analysis using the World Health Organization-Uppasala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) criteria[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>] showed they were in the &#x0201c;possible&#x0201d; category. Laboratory parameters were within normal ranges in both the study groups and no significant changes were detected between baseline and study end. Therefore, the safety and tolerability profile of both the study drugs were good without any reported cases of serious AE.</p><p>The use of concomitant medications in both the groups was comparable and no statistically significant difference was noted between groups. Most of the subjects had taken inhalational salbutamol or levo-salbutamol, ipratropium bromide, and few had taken oral doxophylline or theophyline. There were three diabetics and one hypothyroid patient in gemifloxacin group and two diabetics in cefpodoxime group. However, the percentage of subjects with concomitant illnesses in the two treatment arms was comparable (<italic>P</italic> = 0.75).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this study proved that gemifloxacin is therapeutically comparable to cefpodoxime in clinically suspected cases of AECB, both in terms of efficacy and safety. After treatment with a 7-day course, the clinical success rates were comparable, i.e., 84.6% in the gemifloxacin group and 83.3% in the cefpodoxime group. The number of treatment emergent AEs was also very less, i.e., two in the gemifloxacin group and three in the cefpodoxime group. These adverse events were all mild and non-serious in nature and did not require dose modification or withdrawal of drug therapy. Patient compliance in both the groups was also good.</p><p>Several published studies have evaluated the effectiveness of different flouroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin, prulifloxacin) with macrolides (clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin) or with amoxicillin/clavulanate acid for the treatment of AECB,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT16">16</xref>] but there are no published comparative controlled trials which evaluated a fluoroquinolone with an oral third-generation cephalosporin.</p><p>The results of this study were comparable to that of other published studies which evaluated gemifloxacin or cefpodoxime for the treatment of AECB using clinical improvement treatment outcomes. The clinical success rate with the newer quinolones was about 83&#x02013;84%, which is comparable to our study results. Regarding cost effectiveness of a 7-day course of gemifloxacin versus cefpodoxime, we computed the current costs of both therapies by comparing the market prices of the test brand versus the control brand. Results revealed that gemifloxacin therapy was significantly less expensive (about 2.5-fold less Rupees; `100 versus 250) compared to cefpodoxime therapy.</p><p>Wilson <italic>et al</italic>. conducted an randomised clinical trial (RCT) of gemifloxacin versus clarithromycin in Anthonisen type I AECB subjects and the reported clinical cure rate at 2-3 weeks was 85.4% with gemifloxacin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref>] Another comparative study of a 5-day course of moxifloxacin versus 7-day course of ceftriaxone showed that the clinical success rates were 90.6 and 89%, respectively.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT15">15</xref>] The &#x0201c;Gemifloxacin Long-term Outcome in Bronchitis Evaluation&#x0201d; (GLOBE)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>] trial which compared the clinical and economic outcomes of gemifloxacin versus clarithromycin in AECB patients showed that a 5-day course of gemifloxacin was superior to a 7-day course of clarithromycin and that more patients receiving gemifloxacin remained free of AECB recurrence after 26 weeks compared with those receiving clarithromycin. Very few studies have evaluated the efficacy of cefpodoxime for AECB. A study reported by Periti <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>] compared the efficacy of cefpodoxime with co-amoxiclav and the results showed that the overall clinical efficacy rate with cefpodoxime was 97.2% versus 94.7% with co-amoxiclav.</p><p>Some limitations of this study were as follows. As this was an investigator initiated academic project, a double-blind study could not be conducted due to financial constraints and logistic problems. The dosing schedule of cefpodoxime was twice daily while that of gemifloxacin was once daily. So, for conducting a double-blind study, supply of dummy medications was essential but it could not be arranged. However, to compensate for the bias, the investigator who assessed the subjects clinically and computed the respiratory symptom score was not aware of the subject allocation group. Secondly, we did not perform microbial efficacy of the cases since there are several reports which have stated that mere identification of organisms from the expectorated sputum is not representative of the organism causing AECB as the specimen gets contaminated by the upper airway and laryngeal commensals. Another reason is that very often clinicians start antimicrobial therapy at outpatient setting before the microbial culture report arrives which takes about 72 hours. Therefore, we conducted this study mainly to provide information to clinicians on the comparative effectiveness of these two antibiotics as initial antibiotics for AECB patients based on clinical assessment scores. Third, a prolonged follow-up of subjects to compute the relapse rates also was not done formally as part of the study but we have requested all subjects to come for monthly follow-ups for 6 months after study end visit.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study demonstrated that a 7-day course of gemifloxacin is comparable to cefpodoxime in terms of both clinical effectiveness and safety for the treatment of AECB in an outpatient setting. Gemifloxacin has the additional advantage of a once daily dosing compared to a twice daily dosing for cefpodoxime and a lesser cost of therapy. However, a trial that also evaluated bacteriological cure and relapse rates would have provided supportive scientific evidence.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="CIT1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="other"><source>Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease.
