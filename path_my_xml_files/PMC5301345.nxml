In the absence of somatic factors in the temporomandibular joint, mainly myogenous, psychobiological, and psychosocial factors may be involved in the aetiology of myogenous TMD. An occlusal appliance (splint) is commonly used as a basic therapy of the dental practice. Alternatively, a type of physiotherapy which includes, apart from massage of sore muscles, aspects of cognitive-behavioural therapy might be a basic therapy for myogenous TMD. Treatment outcome of physiotherapy (Ph-Tx) was evaluated in comparison to that of splint therapy (Sp-Tx), using the index Treatment Duration Control (TDC) that enabled a randomized controlled trial with, comparable to clinical care, therapy-and-patient-specific treatment durations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Seventy-two patients were randomly assigned to either Ph-Tx or Sp-Tx, with an intended treatment duration between 10 and 21 or 12 and 30&#x000a0;weeks respectively. Using TDC, the clinician controlled treatment duration and the number of visits needed. A blinded assessor recorded anamnestic and clinical data to determine TDC-values following treatment and a 1-year follow-up, yielding success rate (SR) and effectiveness (mean TDC) as treatment outcomes. Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic>, was determined for pain intensity. Overall SR for stepped-care was assessed in a theoretical model, <italic>i.e</italic>. a second of the two studied therapies was applied if the first treatment was unsuccessful, and the effect of therapy sequence and difference in success rates was examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>SR and effectiveness were similar for Ph-Tx and Sp-Tx (long-term SR: 51&#x02013;60%; TDC: &#x02212;0.512&#x02013; &#x02212;0.575). Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic> was 0.86 (Ph-Tx) and 1.39 (Sp-Tx). Treatment duration was shorter for Ph-Tx (on average 10.4&#x000a0;weeks less; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001).

With a similar SR and effectiveness, physiotherapy has a shorter duration. Thus patients whose initial physiotherapy is unsuccessful can continue earlier with subsequent treatment. The stepped-care model reinforces the conclusion on therapy preference as the overall SR hardly depends on therapy sequence.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>

These disorders are characterized by pain and restricted jaw movements. Inter-therapy outcome was studied for a basic type of TMD. To that end, patients were selected who have muscle disorders alone, corresponding to the myofascial subtype according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria, RDC/TMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], further denoted as myogenous TMD.</p><p>In the absence of somatic factors in the temporomandibular joint, mainly myogenous, psychobiological, and psychosocial factors may be involved in the aetiology of myogenous TMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Regarding myogenous factors, external events, for example, trauma, may initiate peripheral sensitization of nociceptors in the masticatory muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Psychobiological factors include those related to central sensitization and dysfunctional descending pain modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Psychosocial factors related to stress, emotion and somatic awareness interact with psychobiological factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Therapy with an occlusal appliance (splint) is commonly used as a basic TMD treatment in the dental practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. An occlusal splint will alter afferent activity from intra-oral tissues by covering teeth and providing pressure on intra-oral tissues. Furthermore, an occlusal splint alters the position of the temporomandibular joint by increasing the vertical dimension of the mouth. In motor control, a splint changes activity patterns of the jaw closing muscles during clenching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As splint therapy is not specific, the mechanisms underlying its effectiveness are not well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In view of aetiology, a type of physiotherapy which includes, apart from massage of sore muscles, aspects of cognitive-behavioural therapy, might be a basic therapy for myogenous TMD rather than splint therapy. Regarding other features, the extent of a patient&#x02019;s active participation is larger for physiotherapy. Furthermore, patients whose physiotherapy is ended successfully have learned techniques to avoid stress and to relieve pain, which can be used if they feel a need afterwards. Such techniques may avoid the need of using an intra-oral appliance in the long-term. It is therefore of interest to compare treatment outcome of physiotherapy to that of splint therapy.</p><p>The effectiveness of occlusal splint therapy has previously been compared with other therapies or conditions using traditional Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), with a constant period of treatment of 6&#x000a0;weeks to 3&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In clinical care, however, the duration of treatment varies as it depends on the type of therapy as well as on a patient&#x02019;s speed of recovery. When therapies of TMD differ in mean duration, a constant period of evaluation might influence an assessment of success rate and effectiveness. A short period will favour short therapies whereas a long period might be disadvantageous by including post-treatment changes in the outcome.</p><p>For example, when a therapy with a mean duration of 2&#x000a0;months, is arbitrarily ended after 1&#x000a0;month for evaluation, it will be unsuccessful in those patients who respond so slowly that a residual level of signs and symptoms of TMD is not reached after 1&#x000a0;month. Part of these patients will attain a residual level with a longer treatment. Hence, the percentage of successful treatments across the entire patient sample of a therapy (success rate) will be biased towards a smaller value when therapy evaluation is carried out before treatments have been completed. An early evaluation also yields a smaller improvement in an outcome variable, for example pain intensity, of slowly responding patients. Hence, therapy effectiveness which is related to the degree of improvement averaged across the entire patient sample, will then be biased towards a smaller value. When two therapies, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>, are both arbitrarily evaluated after a relatively long period, for example 3&#x000a0;months, while the mean duration of these therapies is 1 and 2&#x000a0;months respectively, the therapy outcome might be confounded by spontaneous changes in signs or symptoms that are unrelated to these therapies, between month 1 and 3 (therapy <italic>A</italic>) and between month 2 and 3 (therapy <italic>B</italic>). If a spontaneous change occurred in the same direction for both therapies (a continuous increase or decrease respectively), this change may be larger for therapy <italic>A</italic> with a post-treatment interval of 2&#x000a0;months than for therapy <italic>B</italic> with an interval of 1&#x000a0;month. If chance fluctuations were involved, the incidence of these may depend on the duration of the post-treatment interval and thus differ between therapies <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. One might argue that chance fluctuations will be diminished by averaging across a patient sample. However, this diminution will be imperfect because patient samples have a limited size. Hence, spontaneous changes may cause artifactual differences between therapies in success rate or effectiveness when unequal post-treatment intervals are involved.</p><p>Thus allowing a therapy-and-patient-specific variation of treatment duration in RCTs will comply with clinical care, and enables an unbiased comparison of the therapeutic potential of different therapies. Such a type of RCT can be applied straightforwardly to non-life threatening disorders like TMD. In contrast to an RCT with variable treatment duration, a traditional RCT does further not provide information on the therapy duration and number of visits needed in individual patients. This information is of interest for a complete costs-effectiveness-analysis, and for attaining an optimal therapy strategy for myogenous TMD as outlined below.</p><p>The first aim of the present study was to evaluate treatment outcome of physiotherapy in comparison to that of splint therapy of myogenous TMD, using the index &#x02018;Treatment Duration Control&#x02019; (TDC) for enabling an RCT with a therapy-and-patient-dependent number of visits and treatment duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. All three features of treatment outcome have been addressed, <italic>i.e.</italic> (1) the time and number of visits needed to decide whether a patient&#x02019;s treatment is either successful or unsuccessful, (2) success rate, and (3) therapy effectiveness (<italic>cf.</italic>
<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>).</p><p>Whereas a multi-therapy modality is most appropriate for patients having TMD as well as major psychological problems, a single form of treatment each time is indicated for most TMD categories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A single treatment modality could be applied, <italic>i.e.</italic> either physiotherapy or splint therapy, as patients with mainly basic signs and symptoms of myogenous TMD were selected (<italic>cf.</italic>
<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). However, like in common clinical care, an initial treatment became unsuccessful in a substantial fraction of the patients (<italic>cf.</italic>
<xref rid="Sec12" ref-type="sec">Results</xref>). Because myogenous TMD is a non-life threatening disorder, a trajectory of stepped-care is possible to increase the overall success rate. A trajectory starts with a first type of therapy which, if not successful, is followed by a second type. Patients whose physiotherapy was unsuccessful in the present study continued with splint therapy and reversely. The overall success rate of a trajectory may depend on (i) the therapies&#x02019; success rate when applied separately, (ii) their sequence of successive application, and (iii) a possible effect on the success rate of a subsequent therapy by the preceding one. The influence of these factors has been examined by using a theoretical stepped-care model.</p><p>The second aim of the study was to examine whether physiotherapy or splint therapy may be preferred as an initial treatment in stepped-care. To that end, all features of therapy outcome were considered as well as outcomes of the stepped-care model. A preliminary report has been published previously, in which patient samples and the validation of TDC were not completed yet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>The study was carried out in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration, and approved by the University Ethics Committee and the Board of Developmental Medicine in the Netherlands (reference: OG/93/002). The myogenous TMD patients were either referred to the Department in Utrecht (85%) or recruited directly from general dental and medical practitioners (15%). Recruitment, interventions and follow-ups occurred between April 1993 and March 2000.</p><p>Out of 2078 patients, 187 patients (9%) were selected who had solely myogenous TMD, using stringent criteria. From these eligible patients, 37 patients (20%; nine males and 28 females) declined participation, mainly because of time and distance reasons. The remaining 150 patients gave informed consent of which 60 patients who had pronounced occlusal interferences participated in an RCT with other interventions (see below), and 90 patients without pronounced occlusal interferences enrolled in the present study. The current procedures were completed by 72 out of 90 patients, 37 patients for physiotherapy and 35 ones for splint therapy. Hence, 18 out of 90 patients (20%) became dropouts (ten patients for physiotherapy and eight patients for splint therapy, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) at various stages of the procedure, for the following reasons: (1) the threshold of signs and symptoms was not met at the start of treatment (one patient assigned to physiotherapy), (2) problems with complying to appointments (work situation, distance), and (3) not able to complete treatment according to the protocol (medical co-intervention, co-morbidity, acute dramatic life events).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Patient flow.

</p><p>Assuming a mean baseline level of pain intensity of 30.6&#x000a0;mm on a 100&#x000a0;mm VAS for TMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], an SD of 19.0, and a reduction of the mean level of 35%, yielded an estimated sample size of 50 patients in each group to achieve a power of 0.80 at a level of type I errors of 5%. Considering the number of complying patients, the power has been calculated post-hoc for two types of outcome variables (<italic>cf.</italic>
<xref rid="Sec12" ref-type="sec">Results</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, &#x02018;Post-hoc power analysis on measures of effectiveness&#x02019;).</p><p>As outlined in our previous study on pain patterns from the same patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], RDC/TMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] was followed to select group Ia and Ib patients (myofascial pain) while excluding group II (disk displacement of the Temporomandibular joint) and group III (arthralgia, arthritis, arthrosis). Patients with mainly basic signs and symptoms of myogenous TMD were selected, <italic>i.e.</italic> patients without possibly confounding influences from the temporomandibular joint, dental anomalies, major psycho-social factors, or factors affecting general health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A specific exclusion criterion was previous treatment with an occlusal splint, occlusal adjustment, or physiotherapy of the masticatory system. Patients who had other treatments for pain (also orofacial pain) more recent than a year, were also excluded. Regarding major psycho-social factors, patients with a recent dramatic life event (details, see ref [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]) and/or psychotherapy and/or use of psycho-medication, were excluded to avoid a possible influence of extremely large levels and fluctuations of stress and/or an influence of types of medication, which might overshadow the treatment effect of physiotherapy or splint therapy. Hence, while stress which is related to common daily activities was still possible, the effect of physiotherapy or splint therapy on myogenous TMD may then be more related to myogenous and psychobiological factors.

</p><p>The aetiologic significance of occlusal interferences in the dentition has been questioned because of weak associations between such interferences and TMD in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, apart from critical considerations on the dental literature about the relationship of occlusion and myogenous orofacial pain, some well controlled clinical and experimental studies are in favour of a possible aetiologic role of occlusal interferences in myogenous TMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Patients with pronounced occlusal interferences were therefore excluded in the present study for diminishing the influence of a possibly confounding factor, using as exclusion criteria: (1) a forward sliding of at least 2&#x000a0;mm and/or lateral sliding of at least 1&#x000a0;mm with respect to centric occlusion; and (2) an interference on the non-active side that is not accompanied with contact on the active side.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Procedures between intake and start of treatment</title><p>At the initial visit, eligible patients were informed about a study on treatment effect. The project funded travel costs, costs of treatment if needed, and costs of, for example, baby-sitting for follow-up visits. All participants were informed in a standardized way about TMD as being a non-life threatening disorder with a lack of an unambiguous cause of the pain and about possible contributing factors. The patients received counselling on avoiding possibly stress-induced habits of grinding, clenching, nail biting or biting on objects like pencils, excessive gum chewing, biting and/or sucking on the lip or cheek, and pressing and/or sucking on the tongue. The patients were further informed that depending on the outcome of the final diagnosis, treatment would start at the second visit and would be based on one of four possibilities: (i) occlusal appliance, (ii) slight occlusal adjustment, (iii) a combination of occlusal appliance and slight occlusal adjustment, or (iv) physiotherapy of the masticatory system. The possibilities of &#x02018;slight occlusal adjustment&#x02019; or its combination with &#x02018;occlusal appliance&#x02019; were applied in another study (paper in preparation) in which myogenous TMD patients with pronounced occlusal interferences participated. In order to blind the patients and clinicians at the initial visit about the treatment allocation following randomization, dental impressions necessary to prepare dental casts for treatment options (i)-(iii) but not (iv) (physiotherapy), were obtained from all patients.</p><p>The patients of the present study were, using computer-generated random data, randomized by an independent researcher, across two therapies: (1) occlusal splint therapy, and (2) physiotherapy of the masticatory system (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Physiotherapy was the active treatment which was compared with a control treatment, occlusal splint therapy. Block randomization was used with an intended block size of 100 patients (90 were realized; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and an allocation ratio of 1:1:1:1 for 4 subgroups, <italic>i.e.</italic> (1.1) splint therapy for &#x02018;younger&#x02019; patients (age&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;median age of 32&#x000a0;years; expected median from ref [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]), (1.2) splint therapy for &#x02018;older&#x02019; patients (age&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;32&#x000a0;years), (2.1) physiotherapy for &#x02018;younger&#x02019; patients, and (2.2) physiotherapy for &#x02018;older&#x02019; patients. By considering these two age groups, a stratification occurred across the therapy groups for age and possibly related factors which might influence treatment success, such as duration of pre-treatment pain and, although not recent (&#x0003e;1&#x000a0;year), a previous treatment for pain. This stratification ensured a similar distribution of pre-treatment values from age-related factors in both patient samples which had a limited size (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;35&#x02013;37compliers; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p>Evaluation of a patient&#x02019;s status was carried out not only by the person who carried out treatment (the &#x02018;clinician&#x02019;, a dentist for dental therapies and a physiotherapist for physiotherapy), but also by an assessor (another dentist) who was blinded to the type of treatment and the patient&#x02019;s medical history. Using data from the assessor, a third dentist, the investigator (author RG), determined the outcome values of TDC, to keep the assessor blinded. When a physiotherapist carried out treatment, a dentist who was responsible for the patient, carried out a final evaluation as &#x02018;clinician&#x02019;. Several clinicians and assessors were available, i.e. ten dentists and five physiotherapists as clinician and four dentists as assessor. All abovementioned persons were specialists in treatment of orofacial pain and TMD, and were calibrated using a pilot group of 20 patients, which was also used for tuning the cut-off value of TDC (&#x02212;0.379, see below) for distinguishing between a successful treatment and an unsuccessful one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Following randomization for therapy, each patient was independently assigned to a particular clinician for treatment and a blinded assessor for the entire procedure. The patients were approximately stratified across the participating clinicians and assessors.</p><p>A similar waiting time between the initial visit and start of treatment occurred for both types of therapy, <italic>i.e.</italic> on average 4.4&#x000a0;weeks (SD 2.6) for splint therapy and 4.4&#x000a0;weeks (SD 2.4) for physiotherapy. The waiting time was at least 2&#x000a0;weeks to enable the scoring of a 2-week pain diary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and the preparation of a maxillary, flat-plane, hard acrylic occlusal appliance (Michigan type) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], for those patients who were assigned to splint therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>General procedure of treatment and outcome</title><p>The score profile of the patients was determined using data from an anamnestic and clinical examination. The anamnestic questionnaire included scoring on adjectival 0&#x02013;4 point scales of five items which were characteristic for mygenous TMD (for details, also for the clinical examination, see Appendix in ref [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]). The questionnaire also included scoring of the intensity of the predominant pain from the masticatory system on a 100&#x000a0;mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS; anchor points: &#x02018;no pain&#x02019; and &#x02018;the most intense pain one can imagine&#x02019;). The clinical examination included scoring of pain intensity on an adjectival 0&#x02013;4 point scale during jaw movements, palpation of jaw muscles, and during clenching. The total number of clinical items was 42. Regarding a threshold of signs and symptoms at the initial visit and the start of treatment, see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, &#x02018;Threshold of signs and symptoms&#x02019;.</p><p>Each therapy had a specific program with a number of visits which could vary depending on the rate of a patient&#x02019;s improvement (see below, section &#x02018;Specific treatment procedures, general features&#x02019;). Hence with an inter-visit interval which was therapy-specific, the duration of treatment could vary. The progress and ultimate effect of treatment were evaluated using the index &#x02018;Treatment Duration Control&#x02019; (TDC). Details of the TDC procedure (including the use of added reference items), and on the validation of TDC can be found elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Only some main features are presented below.</p><p>Baseline scores from anamnestic and clinical items were obtained by a blinded assessor, just before treatment and transferred by the investigator to keep the assessor blinded. This baseline assessment occurred on average 4.4&#x000a0;weeks (SD 2.5) following the initial visit. Using Smallest Detectable Difference (SDD) as a threshold, items with significantly large score values were selected as &#x02018;reference items&#x02019; for monitoring relative change using the index TDC during treatment (by the clinician) and during follow-up (by the investigator, based on data from the blinded assessor).</p><p>The clinician carried out the anamnestic and clinical examination of the patient during the various treatment visits. The relative change in each reference item, between a later visit and the reference visit, was expressed as a contrast value, being the ratio between the difference and the sum of both score values of the reference item. The index TDC is the mean across all contrast values from the various reference items. TDC values vary within a range from +1.000 to &#x02212;1.000, in which 0 represents no change, &#x02212;1.000 represents complete recovery and a positive value represents worsening.</p><p>The clinician&#x02019;s decision to continue or end treatment, thus controlling treatment duration, was based on two cut-off points of TDC. Each cut-off point corresponds to a global relative decrease of the scores of reference items. The first cut-off point was TDC&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.212, which corresponds to a decrease of 35% in a single score of pain intensity at a 100&#x000a0;mm VAS. A less negative value than -0.212 means less change towards recovery. If, at a critical stage of treatment, a patient&#x02019;s TDC was larger than &#x02212;0.212 (less negative, more to zero), the patient was insufficiently responsive to treatment. The second cut-off point, TDC&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.379, was related to attaining functional status for myogenous TMD (potentially &#x02018;successful&#x02019; treatment with a residual level of signs and symptoms), and corresponds to 55% decrease of a single score of pain intensity. Depending on the TDC-outcome, the clinician continued or finished treatment within the limits of possible number of visits and their therapy-specific intervals. If TDC was&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;&#x02212;0.212 after a therapy-specific minimum number of treatment visits, the treatment was ended because the patient was not sufficiently responsive. If &#x02212;0.379&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;TDC&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;&#x02212;0.212, a patient was sufficiently responsive but the treatment was continued as long as the maximal number of visits was not exceeded. If TDC was&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;&#x02212;0.379 at two successive visits, treatment was ended as being potentially successful.</p><p>Patients whose treatment was potentially successful or unsuccessful according to the findings of the clinician, were transferred to the assessor for blinded evaluation. The assessor carried out the anamnestic and clinical examination, on average 3.6&#x000a0;weeks (SD 6.0) after the end of treatment for all patients. The waiting time between the end of treatment and the first post-treatment visit for blinded evaluation was at least 2&#x000a0;weeks to enable the scoring of a 2-week pain diary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. For ethical reasons, patients with an unsuccessful treatment in the short-term, according to the data from the assessor, had no follow-up. Their initial unsuccessful treatment was immediately followed by another treatment (stepped-care). The other patients (successful treatment in the short-term) had a follow-up of 6&#x000a0;months and the follow-up was continued for another 6&#x000a0;months (thus 12&#x000a0;months follow-up in total) for those patients whose treatment was still successful after 6&#x000a0;months. The investigator determined post-treatment TDC-values for each patient using solely data from the blinded assessor.</p><p>Following the introduction of all score values in a custom-made spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel&#x000ae;; available on request) the reference items were automatically detected and all TDC-values were automatically determined for each patient.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Specific treatment procedures, general features</title><p>For each type of treatment, a usual bandwidth of possible visits and their intervals was defined <italic>a priori</italic>. For splint therapy, the adaptive program (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, &#x02018;Rules for progressing and ending splint therapy&#x02019;) could result in a number of visits and a treatment duration which varied within a range of 3&#x02013;6 (visits) and 12&#x02013;30 weeks (duration). For physiotherapy (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, &#x02018;Rules for progressing and ending physiotherapy&#x02019;), the possible number of visits varied within a range of 10&#x02013;16 and the treatment duration within a range of 10&#x02013;21 weeks. Although the visit program was respected as much as possible, like in usual clinical care, this program could somewhat be adapted in view of holidays, illness or limitations of appointment opportunities.

This procedure included counselling, a therapy-and-patient-specific duration of treatment, and possibly intermediate adjustment of an occlusal splint. Furthermore, patients whose therapy was successful were allowed to apply splint wearing or physiotherapy (home exercise) respectively when they would feel a need. The influence on pain intensity of the standardized reassurance and counselling which preceded both types of therapy, will first be discussed, followed by the influence of treatment on pain intensity. The post-treatment TDC-values will be discussed thereafter.</p><p>The intensity of the predominant pain from the masticatory system decreased on average 32% between the initial visit (100%) and the start of treatment with a CD of 16.6 scale-%. The value of Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic>, on average 0.80, reflects a moderate/large effect of counselling on pain intensity. Pain intensity was constant in a pain diary, during 2&#x000a0;weeks before the start of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Hence, the decrease of pain intensity occurred shortly after counselling rather than late in the waiting period of 4.4&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>Regarding other studies, in a heterogeneous sample of TMD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], pain intensity decreased similarly by 34% (CD: 22.8 scale-%), with an effect size <italic>d</italic> of 1.13 (mean and SD values of <italic>d</italic> derived from a Figure), following counselling and a waiting period of 2&#x000a0;weeks. A similar decrease of 15.4% (CD 10.1 scale %, <italic>d</italic>: 0.73) of pain intensity was observed 1&#x000a0;month following initial visit and solely counselling, during maximum unassisted jaw opening in myogenous TMD patients whose jaw opening was limited (RDC/TMD: class 1b) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>Because of a general association with pain and the decrease of pain intensity following counselling, the signs and symptoms of one patient assigned to physiotherapy decreased below the threshold following the initial visit, so that this patient became a dropout. Hence, for patients with a low level of signs and symptoms at the initial visit, treatment may be restricted to counselling and instructing simple stretch and auto-massage techniques. A future application of the TDC-procedure from the initial visit will be of interest to determine objectively for which patients counselling and education will be sufficient to attain functional status.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Effect of Treatment on Pain Intensity</title><p>Because counselling at the initial visit causes a fast decrease in pain intensity which stabilizes, a further decrease must be due to the applied therapy, rather than to a natural course of the disorder.

In these previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], the effectiveness of either physiotherapy or splint therapy has been examined using a constant treatment duration between 5 and 10&#x000a0;weeks, and treatment was preceded or combined with counselling including reassurance of the patients. Following splint therapy, CD of maximal pain was 23.2 scale-% (final evaluation after 5&#x000a0;weeks, active splint group) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and 28.8 scale-% (12&#x000a0;months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and <italic>d</italic> was 0.99 and 1.48 respectively. Following physiotherapy, CD of present pain was 22.5 scale-% for intra-oral physiotherapy alone and 34.9 scale-% for a combination of such physiotherapy and education (12&#x000a0;months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In another study on physiotherapy (6&#x000a0;weeks, combined groups) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], CD was 25.4 scale-% for maximal pain and <italic>d</italic> was 1.35. The number of treatment visits (10&#x02013;18) in the previous studies on physiotherapy was similar to the ones in the present study (mean 11.5 visits, SD 2.0). The number of treatment visits for splint therapy was five in the study of Raphael and Marbach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] which is similar to the mean one in the present study (4.4 visits), and at least two visits in the study of Ekberg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The number of visits from the previous studies on splint therapy does not include additional visits for a withdrawal of wearing the splint when splint therapy became successful. Treatment durations of 5&#x02013;10 weeks in these studies are therefore a lower limit of a realistic duration.</p><p>The abovementioned findings show that when splint therapy is preceded or combined with counselling including reassuring the patients, this therapy has a large effectiveness which is similar to that of physiotherapy from separate studies. However, without such counselling, there was no effect of splint therapy on pain intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Following 3&#x000a0;months of splint therapy (6 visits with only splint control), CD for intensity of spontaneous muscle pain was &#x02212;2.8 scale-% and Cohen&#x02019;s effect size (ES: ratio between difference in means and baseline SD) was merely &#x02212;0.14 (negative sign: slight worsening). An effect of solely splint therapy was also lacking for pain intensity during gum chewing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], <italic>i.e.</italic> CD was 3.4 scale-% and ES was 0.11. The effect of solely counselling and education which was repeated 6 times during 3&#x000a0;months was moderate for intensity of spontaneous muscle pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], <italic>i.e.</italic> CD was 11.2 scale-% and ES was 0.58 and small for pain intensity during gum chewing (CD: 7.0 scale-%, ES: 0.30). Thus all findings suggest that a synergy occurs between counselling and splint therapy, <italic>i.e.</italic> absence of counselling blocks the potential effect of splint therapy and/or splint therapy enhances the effect of counselling. Because the effect of a one-time counselling at the initial visit was stabilized in the present study before splint therapy was started, blocking of the effect of splint therapy is probably involved anyhow.</p><p>The small/moderate effect of solely counselling during 3&#x000a0;months was reflected in a relatively large VAS-score of intensity of spontaneous muscle pain (30&#x000a0;mm on a 100&#x000a0;mm VAS) or pain following chewing (38&#x000a0;mm) at the end of the program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Such end levels of pain intensity, which are even higher than the mean ones for patients whose treatment was unsuccessful in the present study (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), are much higher than that of patients with a successful treatment, who have attained functional status (mean pain score&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;7&#x000a0;mm; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Hence, solely counselling and education will, in general, not be sufficiently effective to attain functional status within a reasonable time. This conclusion is reinforced by findings from another study on myogenous TMD patients (RDC/TMD: class 1b) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Although monthly counselling continuously decreased the intensity of pain at maximum unassisted mouth opening, this intensity was still large following 3&#x000a0;months (43&#x000a0;mm) and 12&#x000a0;months (27&#x000a0;mm). The large effectiveness which was observed for physiotherapy in the present study might in part be due to a repeated education procedure which is inherently part of this type of physiotherapy.</p><p>In the present study, Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic> of pain intensity was significantly larger for splint therapy (<italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.39) than for physiotherapy (<italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.86), for the entire therapy groups. However, the inter-therapy <italic>d</italic>-values were similar for the sub-samples of patients whose treatment was successful (<italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.02&#x02013;2.07) or unsuccessful (<italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.39&#x02013;0.73). The larger overall <italic>d</italic>-value for splint therapy reflects a value of success rate for splint therapy which, although not significant, was slightly larger than that for physiotherapy (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Thus slightly more patients with a successful treatment and therefore a larger <italic>d</italic>-value, contribute to the overall <italic>d</italic>-value of splint therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>TDC outcome of effectiveness and success rate</title><p>Advantages of considering the post-treatment TDC outcome as a measure of effectiveness are an involvement of scores from various signs and symptoms of myogenous TMD rather than from solely pain intensity, and therefore also more statistical power to detect possible inter-therapy differences. The similar mean post-treatment TDC-values for physiotherapy and splint therapy (&#x02212;0.512&#x02013; &#x02212;0.575, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) indicate a similar effectiveness and a large effect size (TDC&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;&#x02212;0.379) for both types of therapy. The post-treatment TDC-values were also similar between both therapies, in subgroups of patients for which treatment was successful or unsuccessful. The post-treatment TDC-values for patients whose treatment was unsuccessful (&#x02212;0.200&#x02013; &#x02212;0.208) which were larger (less negative) than others, differed nevertheless significantly from zero (TDC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0 means no change). Thus even in patients whose treatment was unsuccessful, their signs and symptoms improved significantly and similarly for both therapies. The success rate based on post-treatment TDC-values from individual patients is also similar between both therapies, <italic>i.e.</italic> 73&#x02013;83% in the short-term and 51&#x02013;60% in the long-term (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Considerations on Success Rate of Therapies</title><p>Patients with mainly basic signs and symptoms of myogenous TMD were selected in the present study. This selection is reflected in mean baseline values of various psycho-social factors which, in general, correspond to a low degree of involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Significant differences did, in general, not occur between these baseline values for patients whose treatment became successful or unsuccessful respectively. Only internal locus of control differed for physiotherapy, <italic>i.e.</italic> patients whose physiotherapy became successful believed more that own health is controlled by their own behaviour than patients whose physiotherapy became unsuccessful. This outcome may be related to the degree of the patients&#x02019; active participation during physiotherapy. The difference in mean score level was however small, <italic>i.e.</italic> 9.2% with respect to the mutual mean. Baseline values of age or clinical variables from the present study did also not influence a patient&#x02019;s responsiveness to a therapy. Regardless of the type of therapy, a modest use of OTC-medication (mean: 3&#x02013;7% of the times of scoring) is not specifically related to any of the two treatment outcomes (successful/unsuccessful). Although larger patient groups are needed for more power in testing frequencies, this finding suggests that such a modest use may have only a small influence on success rate.</p><p>Despite a selection of &#x02018;basic&#x02019; myogenous TMD patients, the success rates in the short-term (73&#x02013;83%) were similar to that reported in text books for TMD in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The success rates in the long-term (51&#x02013;60%) were such that a large fraction of the patients, on average 44%, still needed a subsequent treatment, regardless of the type of initial therapy. In contrast to previous studies, profoundly confounding factors which might hamper an improvement in central pain mechanisms, were excluded in the present study. A patient&#x02019;s treatment may therefore become unsuccessful merely because the patient&#x02019;s speed of recovery is intrinsically low. Post-treatment TDC-values indicate that even for patients whose treatment is unsuccessful, their TMD signs and symptoms have improved significantly. This improvement is also reflected as a significant decrease in pain intensity alone. The decrease in pain intensity does not continue beyond the end of treatment, as although not significant, the mean pain intensity was slightly larger at the first post-treatment visit than at the end of treatment about 4&#x000a0;weeks earlier (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). For patients whose initial therapy is unsuccessful, stepped-care with a subsequent therapy is therefore necessary to attain a further decrease in pain intensity and other signs and symptoms beyond a critically low residual level.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Preference of Initial Therapy in Stepped-Care</title><p>Our suggestions for an optimal treatment strategy refer to myogenous TMD which is not confounded by overt psychological problems, or severe sleep bruxism (SB) as diagnosed instrumentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. A multi-therapy modality is more appropriate for patients with major psychological problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. An occlusal appliance may still be preferred for active SB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], because, apart from reducing SB, further extreme tooth wear is prevented.</p><p>In order to assess the outcome of stepped-care from the present study, a single telephone survey was carried out at the end of the project, 1&#x02013;4 years following the end of a trajectory of 1&#x02013;2 therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This survey, using the anamnestic questionnaire with eight items from the TDC-procedure (assessing pain intensity by a 0&#x02013;10 point score), revealed that 93% of all patients had no need for treatment anymore. This success rate for stepped-care corresponds with the mean of the range of overall success rates (91&#x02013;95%) in the stepped-care model using the basic success rates of physiotherapy and splint therapy, and a value of the modulation factor <italic>m</italic> which is larger than one (<italic>m&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.5</italic>; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). This finding suggests that, regardless of the sequence of physiotherapy and splint therapy, the initial treatment triggers an improvement that, although insufficient for patients whose initial treatment becomes unsuccessful, enhances the success rate of the subsequent treatment.</p><p>Physiotherapy may be preferred as initial therapy over occlusal splint therapy in stepped-care of myogenous TMD, for four reasons. First, with a similar success rate and effectiveness, the duration of physiotherapy is, on average, 10.4&#x000a0;weeks shorter. Hence, patients whose initial physiotherapy is unsuccessful can continue earlier with subsequent treatment thus lowering the risk on a sustained chronicity of pain.</p><p>Second, the stepped-care model shows that small and even moderately large inter-therapy differences in basic success rate are not important. The overall success rate of stepped-care does not depend on the therapy sequence, irrespective of any inter-therapy difference in basic success rate, if the success rate of a subsequent therapy is not influenced by the preceding one (<italic>m&#x02009;=&#x02009;1</italic>). For a wide range of <italic>m</italic>-values around <italic>m&#x02009;=&#x02009;1</italic> (<italic>0&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;m&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2</italic>), the difference in overall success rate between the two possible trajectories is smaller than the inter-therapy difference in basic success rate. Hence, the overall success rate of stepped-care hardly depends on therapy sequence. For basic myogenous TMD, an unsuccessful initial treatment most likely enhances the success rate of the subsequent treatment (<italic>m&#x02009;&#x02248;&#x02009;1.5</italic>). The largest overall success rate of stepped-care is then even attained by choosing the therapy with the lower basic success rate as the initial therapy, hence physiotherapy.</p><p>Third, the same therapeutic techniques of physiotherapy can be applied to decrease pain or pain-related function impairment of other body parts than facial ones, like the neck and shoulders. Pain was not restricted to facial areas in 69% of the patients (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). A broader application of physiotherapy might even increase its basic success rate. Fourth, at least in the Netherlands, the costs of a trajectory that starts with physiotherapy, are lower.</p><p>Physiotherapy might have a disadvantage, <italic>i.e.</italic> the number of visits is on average 7.1 larger than for splint therapy. If availability of a physiotherapist is limited, for example for patients living in rural areas, or if patients have limitations of transportation and/or time, splint therapy might still be preferred as initial treatment. However, technology-assisted interventions, including internet-based ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], may diminish the disadvantage of physiotherapy. In-person treatment may, at least in part, be replaced by internet-assisted treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study includes some limitations. First, patients with mainly basic signs and symptoms of solely myogenous TMD were selected to facilitate straightforward conclusions on therapy outcome. The prevalence of solely myogenous TMD is low in samples of patients who are referred to a specialized clinic, for example, 4.5% of all TMD patients in a tertiary clinic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], and 9.0% in the present study where patients were mainly (85%) referred to a clinic for Special Dental Care. However, this prevalence is much higher in a more general clinic, <italic>i.e.</italic> 39.5% in an outpatient physical therapy practice (myogenous TMD without arthralgia) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], and 47.8% in a university dental clinic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The prevalence is also higher, 36.1%, in a community sample of young women (age 19&#x02013;23 years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Hence, the results of the present study are representative for about 40&#x02013;48% of all TMD patients, <italic>i.e.</italic> patients who have an age range of 18&#x02013;65 years (median at about 32&#x000a0;years), and a need of treatment for solely myogenous TMD. This conclusion is reinforced by the finding that the patients from the present study are largely comparable to those with myogenous TMD from previous studies in which selection was less amended (for a detailed discussion, see ref [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]).</p><p>Second, patient groups with placebo treatments or a long waiting period were not included for ethical reasons. Using a placebo group in non-pharmacological studies may be theoretically, methodologically, practically, and ethically unsound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Regarding a placebo effect of occlusal splint therapy, the effectiveness of a splint which does not cover the teeth but only the palate (palatal splint) is either similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], or corresponds in part to the effectiveness of an occlusal splint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, occlusal splint therapy and physiotherapy have in common an extensive non-noxious mechanical stimulation of peri-oral and/or intra-oral tissues. A palatal splint also causes mechanical stimulation of intra-oral tissues. Non-noxious mechanical stimulation, hence stimulation of afferent A-&#x003b2; fibres, may relieve pain by modulation of central pain mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In order to avoid any stimulation of tissues, a sham laser treatment may be an appropriate placebo treatment. Recording the patients&#x02019; expectation on improvement will then be useful for assessing the role of this factor in effectiveness of various treatment modalities. Recording this expectation will also solve the third limitation of the present study.</p><p>Although a non-treatment group was not included in the present study, two waiting periods of about 4&#x000a0;weeks were present in both treatment modalities, before and after treatment. These waiting periods were long enough to show, in addition with a 2-week-pain diary, that the effect of one-time counselling at the initial visit (all patients) stabilized as well as the effect of an unsuccessful treatment. An initial treatment was stepped up for ethical reasons, when it was unsuccessful at a post-treatment occasion of evaluation. Because the decrease of pain intensity was halted following the end of an unsuccessful initial treatment, it is unlikely that the success rate and the last TDC-value would have altered by a spontaneous improvement if a follow-up of 1 year were completed. In a study using a waiting list of 1 year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], intensity of various types of pain did not change in myogenous TMD patients.</p><p>Bias by regression to the mean is avoided by using TDC-values as outcome parameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. TDC is therefore useful in future research to examine changes of all pronounced signs and symptoms during all phases, thus from the initial visit up to the end of a possible second treatment of a trajectory.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Physiotherapy and occlusal splint therapy have similar success rates and effectiveness. Because the duration of physiotherapy is on average 10.4&#x000a0;weeks shorter than that of splint therapy, physiotherapy may be preferred as initial therapy over occlusal splint therapy in stepped-care of basic myogenous TMD which is not confounded by major psychological problems or severe active sleep bruxism. Patients whose initial physiotherapy is unsuccessful can then continue earlier with subsequent treatment. The stepped-care model reinforces the conclusion on therapy preference as the overall success rate of stepped-care in which possibly two successive therapies are involved, hardly depends on therapy sequence.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec21"><title>Additional files</title><p>
