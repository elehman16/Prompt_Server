Diabetic nephropathy is also closely associated with higher cardiovascular mortality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, additional efforts are needed to arrest the progression of diabetic nephropathy.</p><p>A low-protein diet slows the progression of renal disease and improves survival in patients with various glomerulopathies, including diabetic kidney disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Clinically, a meta-analysis suggested that low-protein diet lowers the incidence of ESRD or death in patients with non-diabetic nephropathies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Another meta-analysis of 108 patients with type 1 diabetes in five studies (mean follow-up 4.5&#x02013;35&#x000a0;months) showed the benefit of low-protein diet in slowing the progression of diabetic nephropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Indeed, a low-protein diet is recommended as nutritional management of diabetic nephropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], although there is insufficient evidence to suggest that such a diet improves renal dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The landmark study of non-diabetic kidney disease, the Modification of diet in renal disease study (MDRD), also failed to reach a conclusion regarding the benefits of a low-protein diet in reducing risk of ESRD or death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, extended follow-up after the MDRD trial also failed to show a significant benefit of low-protein diet in slowing the development of ESRD and all-cause mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>To explore the uncertainties on effectiveness of low-protein diet, we conducted a randomised controlled trial to determine the effect of low-protein diet on the progression of renal dysfunction and albuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients with overt nephropathy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p><bold>Study design</bold> This was a multi-site randomised controlled trial for prevention of diabetic nephropathy progression among 112 type 2 diabetic patients, who were aged 30 to 70&#x000a0;years and had overt nephropathy. The trial was conducted from 1 December 1997 to 30 April 2006. After a baseline run-in period (3&#x000a0;months), the patients were monitored for 5&#x000a0;years. The protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of each centre. All participating patients provided written, informed consent. Before the present study, 41 diabetic patients with overt nephropathy had been randomly assigned to normal protein intake (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;21) and low protein intake (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20) groups. This 1&#x000a0;year feasibility trial was completed by 34 patients. Daily protein intake in the feasibility study was 1.22&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.25&#x000a0;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (normal) and 0.92&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.43&#x000a0;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (low protein) and the difference was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Based on these data, sample size for the present study was calculated. To achieve 90% power with a 5% significance level, we found that least 31 participants per group would be necessary. To account for drop-out due to trial duration, a 100 participants (50 per group) were planned for analysis.</p><p><bold>Participants</bold> The participants were Japanese men and women, aged 30 to 70&#x000a0;years. All had type 2 diabetes (defined according to World Health Organization criteria) of at least 5&#x000a0;years duration and were being treated by diet or by diet plus oral hypoglycaemic agents or insulin injection. Other inclusion criteria were: (1) urinary protein excretion more than 1&#x000a0;g/day but less than 10&#x000a0;g/day; (2) urinary albumin excretion rate of more than 200 &#x000b5;g/min at least twice in a 1 year period; (3) serum creatinine below 176&#x02009;&#x000b5;mol/l; (4) at least simple diabetic retinopathy; and (5) on normal-protein diet (1.2&#x000a0;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000a0;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Potential participants were excluded if they had: type 1 diabetes; other renal diseases; body weight less than 80% of ideal body weight; clinically significant illness such as congestive heart failure, hepatic disease, recent myocardial infarction and stroke, and urinary tract infection; or if they were being treated with a low-protein diet (0.8&#x000a0;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and/or ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Hypertension was defined as blood pressure&#x02265;140/90&#x000a0;mmHg or use of anti-hypertensive drugs.</p><p><bold>Randomisation and intervention</bold> During the 3&#x000a0;month screening period, the participants continued to take a normal-protein diet (1.2&#x000a0;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and their usual medications. They were then randomly assigned at a central location to follow either a low-protein diet (0.8&#x000a0;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) or a normal-protein diet (1.2&#x000a0;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) with the appropriate energy intake for each participant without masking.The methods of minimisation for allocation were applied according to age, sex, serum creatinine, estimated GFR (eGFR), and urinary albumin and protein levels during the screening period. Both groups were instructed to meet the registered dietitian for 30&#x000a0;min every 3&#x000a0;months to assess and counsel dietary issues. After randomisation we followed the participants for approximately 3.5&#x000a0;years (1&#x02013;5&#x000a0;years). Every 3&#x000a0;months, all participants completed a 3&#x000a0;day food record to assess daily protein, energy and sodium intake. For this purpose, we used the fourth revised and enlarged edition of <italic>Standard tables of food composition in Japan</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The dietary protein intake was also assessed by urinary urea nitrogen excretion during 24&#x000a0;h urine collection every 3&#x000a0;months, using the formula of Maroni et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. To achieve dietary protein goals, dietary regimens were modified every 3&#x000a0;months or more as needed. The estimated protein intake during the study represents the mean of all measurements after randomisation.</p><p><bold>Laboratory tests</bold> Blood and urine samples were brought to the central laboratory (SRL, Tokyo, Japan) and each clinical parameter was measured using the Hitachi 7170 analyzer (Hitachi High-Technologies, Tokyo, Japan) unless otherwise specified. GFR was estimated using the following modified MDRD formula for Japanese participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref><bold>]</bold>: eGFR (ml&#x000a0;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>)=175&#x000d7;[serum creatinine (&#x003bc;mol/l)/88.4]<sup>&#x02212;1.154</sup>&#x000d7;[age (years)]<sup>&#x02212;0.203</sup>&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;0.741&#x000d7;(0.742&#x000a0;if female), where serum creatinine estimated by an enzymatic method was calibrated. Creatinine clearance from a 24&#x000a0;h timed urine collection was calculated and corrected to a body surface area of 1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>. Urinary excretion of protein and albumin was measured every 3&#x000a0;months in 24&#x000a0;h timed urine samples using an immunoturbidity assay and a pyrogallol red&#x02013;molybdate complex (LX60000; Eiken Chemical Co., Tokyo, Japan), respectively. Urinary nitrogen was measured by an enzymatic ultraviolet method every 3&#x000a0;months. Blood samples were obtained every 3&#x000a0;months to measure: renal function (blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, Na, K, Cl, uric acid) by an autoanalyser; lipids (total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, HDL-cholesterol) by an enzymatic colorimetric method and a direct inhibition method, respectively; transferrin by an immunoturbidity assay (BN-II; Dade Boehring, Marbug, Germany); serum glucose by a glucose oxidase method; and HbA<sub>1c</sub> by ion exchange HPLC (ADAMS A1c HA-8160; Aarkray, Kyoto, Japan).</p><p><bold>Outcomes</bold> The primary outcomes were: (1) the annual change in eGFR and creatinine clearance; (2) the incidence of doubling of serum creatinine; and (3) the time to doubling of baseline serum creatinine. The secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients with ESRD requiring haemodialysis and the annual changes in urinary protein and albumin excretion. Quality of life was assessed annually using the SF-36 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].The secondary analysis, which was not based on a direct comparison of randomised groups, was performed to assess the biological dose&#x02013;response relationship between actual protein intake and progression of type 2 diabetic nephropathy.</p><p><bold>Statistical analysis</bold> An independent data and safety monitoring board monitored the study. The Lan&#x02013;DeMets alpha spending-function method was used to adjust for interim analyses once a year. Four formal interim analyses were performed during the study period. The <italic>p</italic> value for one interim analyses was set at <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01. Data handling and trial management were coordinated centrally by EPS (Tokyo, Japan).The mean dietary protein intake between the low- and normal-protein diet groups was analysed using Wilcoxon&#x02019;s rank sum test. Dietary protein intake in the low- and normal-protein diet groups during the study was analysed by repeated measures ANOVA.Analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle; we included data from all randomised patients with the exception of the 24 participants lost or excluded between randomisation and study termination (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). For continuous variables, the mean and standard deviation were calculated. Because of the skewed deviation, values for albuminuria and proteinuria are given as medians and interquartile ranges. In calculating the slopes of the rates of change of eGFR and creatinine clearance, linear regression analysis was used and included the data of patients who reached an endpoint. A minimum of 1&#x000a0;year follow-up with at least two measurements of serum and urinary creatinine during the study period were aggregated in the slope analysis. Primary outcome values between groups were assessed by an analysis of covariance model, with low-protein diet as a factor and baseline urinary protein, serum creatinine, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, systolic blood pressure and daily protein intake, in addition to age and sex, as covariates. The incidence of doubling of serum creatinine was compared with the <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> test. The times to doubling of baseline serum creatinine and its components were compared by Kaplan&#x02013;Meier survival curves and the log-rank test. Baseline serum creatinine was adjusted using Cox proportional hazards models with terms for the diet assignment. Secondary outcomes were compared with the <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> test (for non-parametric data) or repeated measures ANOVA (for continuous data).

Low-protein diet did not slow the rate of progression of nephropathy as estimated not only by the incidence of doubling of serum creatinine, but also by the time to doubling of serum creatinine concentration, compared with the normal-protein diet group. The mean annual change in eGFR and creatinine clearance was also similar between the two groups. The secondary analysis, which assessed the association between the rate of progression of diabetic nephropathy and the achieved protein intake, also failed to find a beneficial effect. Based on the time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model, no renal benefit of low-protein diet was observed, although systolic blood pressure significantly influenced the progression of diabetic nephropathy. We thus interpret these results to indicate that a low-protein diet is probably not renoprotective in patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy.</p><p>In a long-term study similar to ours, Pijls et al. reported that protein restriction is neither feasible nor efficacious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], although they had recruited type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria (30&#x02013;300&#x000a0;mg/day) and relatively high albuminuria within the normo-albuminuric range (albuminuria &#x0003e;20&#x000a0;mg/day or detectable urinary albumin, i.e. albumin concentration &#x0003e;6.5&#x000a0;mg/l). In contrast, Hansen et al. performed a 4&#x000a0;year prospective, controlled trial with concealed randomisation to compare the decline in GFR and development of ESRD or death in type 1 diabetes patients with advanced diabetic nephropathy comparable to our participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Their usual-protein diet group consumed 1.02&#x000a0;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> as compared with 0.89 (range 0.83&#x02013;0.95) g&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in the low-protein diet group, a protein intake similar to our groups. However, in contrast to our findings, Hansen et al found that type 1 diabetic patients suffering from progressive diabetic nephropathy experienced a beneficial effect of moderately restricted dietary protein on the development of ESRD or mortality rates. The discrepancy might be due to the different types of diabetes and/or use of antihypertensive drugs, with almost 90% of patients in their study taking ACE-I. In our study, patients were instructed not to take ACE-I and/or ARBs, as these had not been approved for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy in Japan when this study was completed.</p><p>The prescribed protein intake in the low-protein group in our study (approximately 0.8&#x000a0;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) resulted in a mean achieved protein intake of about 1.0&#x000a0;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, as estimated by urinary nitrogen excretion, which was not statistically different from protein intake in the normal-protein diet. Since diabetic patients have to accept other restrictions to their diet regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], compliance to an additional low-protein diet could be reduced. The achieved level of long-term dietary protein restriction may reflect everyday life in an outpatient clinic set-up. Therefore, we cannot directly address the issue of whether the effects of lower protein intake such as 0.8&#x000a0;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, the amount recommended in a nutritional statement by the American Diabetes Association (2008) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], would be beneficial for type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy. Non-adherence to the prescribed low-protein diet would result in underestimation of the true beneficial effect of the low-protein diet in the present study. However, it is not reasonable to assume that a lower protein intake equal to or less than 0.8&#x000a0;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> would reduce the risk of progression of diabetic nephropathy, because the relationship between achieved protein intake (0.55&#x02013;1.6&#x000a0;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and annual rate of eGFR decline as well as creatinine clearance decline also failed to produce any benefits for low-protein diet in our study. The MDRD, moreover, also failed to reach a conclusion on this issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Indeed, the recent long-term follow-up of the MDRD provides evidence that even very low protein diet, supplemented with keto acids and amino acids, increased the risk of death without the benefit of delaying progression of kidney diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we found that systolic blood pressure, rather than other variables such as blood glucose control, daily protein intake and sodium intake, played a major role in accelerating the progression of diabetic nephropathy during the follow-up period. Our results suggest that blood pressure control results in inhibition of progression of diabetic nephropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, coexisistence of hypertension and type 2 diabetes is well known to accelerate the risk not only of development and progression of diabetic nephropathy, but also of cardiovascular disease outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], meaning that control of high blood pressure is a major protective strategy against renal and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Indeed, recent guidelines recommend treating type 2 diabetic patients with antihypertensive drugs, if their blood pressure is in the high-normal (previously normal) range (130&#x02013;139/85&#x02013;90&#x000a0;mmHg), and sometimes even if blood pressure is in the normal and/or low prehypertensive range (120&#x02013;129/80&#x02013;85&#x000a0;mmHg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Although previous experimental data suggested that the effects of low-protein diet, similar to treatment with an ACE-I or ARBs, are mediated through blockade of the renal renin&#x02013;angiotensin system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], dietary protein restriction in the present study, where patients were not on ACE-I or ARBs, did not seem to act through the renin&#x02013;angiotensin system. At present, adding ACE-I or ARB to multifactorial intervention could reduce the progression of diabetic nephropathy, as reported in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Interestingly, a recent report by Parving et al. showed that without restriction of dietary salt or protein, the use of the renin inhibitor, aliskiren, in combination with an ARB efficiently reduces urinary albuminuria in diabetic patients with overt proteinuria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>In summary, it is extremely difficult to get patients to follow a long-term low-protein diet, and although overall protein intake was slightly (but not significantly) lower, it did not confer renoprotection. Our data may shed the light on the dietary management of diabetic nephropathy. One possible result is that protein restriction may not remain a main nutritional recommendation in clinical practice, because we now have a most valuable therapeutic strategy for reducing progression of diabetic nephropathy as well as cardiovascular events and mortality rates by using intensive multifactorial interventions such as lifestyle management, ACE-I or ARBs, and lipid-lowering drugs, as reported in the Steno-2 study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Without additional data, we must continue to base decisions on the current balance of evidence for and against the efficacy and safety of dietary protein restriction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="N0x1cd0390N0x2d9a548" content-type="local-data"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
