Most foot pain related to ill-fitting shoes occurs in the forefoot and digital areas. Pain has been associated with poor shoe fit, reduced toe box volume, as well as contour and shape of the shoe Off-the-shelf medical-grade footwear is designed as an intervention for chronic lesions on the digits. These shoes are designed with a flexible neoprene fabric upper that is thought to reduce pressure on the forefoot and reduce discomfort associated with ill-fitting shoes. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of an off-the-shelf, medical-grade shoe on dorsal digital pressure and perceived comfort when compared to participant&#x02019;s own preferred shoe.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Thirty participants (18 females, 12 males) scored their perceived comfort whilst wearing each footwear style using a visual analog comfort scale. Dorsal digital and interdigital pressures were measured in using the WalkinSense&#x000ae; in-shoe pressure system. Sensors were placed on predetermined anatomical landmarks on the digits. Participants were randomly assigned the test shoe and their own shoe. Once wearing the shoe, the participants walked across a 6&#x000a0;m walkway and pressure data from each sensor was collected and processed to obtain peak pressure, time to peak pressure and contact time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Participants scored the test shoe with higher comfort points than their own footwear. Overall peak pressure, pressure time integral and contact time decreased, whilst the time taken to reach peak pressure increased across all anatomical landmarks whilst wearing the test shoe. Statistically significant changes were observed for all of the measured variables relating to pressure on the medial border of the first metatarsophalangeal joint.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The test shoe provided greater comfort and reduced the amount of pressure on the forefoot. The medical-grade footwear therefore, is a viable alternative to custom made prescription footwear and is more suitable than a regular everyday shoe when treating digital lesions associated with pressure.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Comfort</kwd><kwd>Footwear</kwd><kwd>Prescription footwear</kwd><kwd>Pressure measurement</kwd><kwd>Footwear fit</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>The forefoot has been highlighted as the most frequent area of pain related to footwear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Forefoot pain is commonly associated with wearing ill-fitting footwear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], causing pressure over bony prominences on the dorsum of the lesser toes, the medial aspect of the first metatarsal head or the lateral aspect of the fifth metatarsal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In the long term, it is thought that the toes can adapt to footwear restrictions by extension of the metatarsophalangeal joints and flexion of the proximal interphalangeal joints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Additionally, it has been shown that the forefoot is stiffer in habitually shod individuals and this loss of mobility may lead to greater incidences of forefoot pathology and deformity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Digital deformities are subject to hyperkeratotic lesions, clavi, or ulcerations specifically on the interphalangeal joints which are subjected to frequent friction from adjacent toes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A high proportion of corns are located on the dorsum of the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> toes which often assume an elevated position as the first and fifth toes are forced to adapt to the confined area of the toe box of the shoe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies conclude that wearing a shoe with a reduced toe box volume and shape may have poor foot health outcomes. It is suggested that this is caused by constriction of the toes which are associated with foot deformities including the development of joint pathologies and forefoot lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It is thought that shoes which do not have the capacity to accommodate the forefoot will alter the dynamics of the transverse metatarsal arch, restricting the metatarsal splay of the forefoot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Poorly fitting footwear is thought to compress the digits and alter function, eventually leading to structural changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This compression can subsequently increase the pressure from the upper of the shoe on the toes and tissue breakdown/ulceration may occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The design of the toe box related to depth and shape can impact the intensity of pressure, with a round styling on the medial border causing the least pressure and a pointed gradient to the lateral border improving pressure on the fifth digit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, this toe box shaping is not often seen in high street shoes contributing to incorrect fit of footwear.</p><p>Ill-fitting footwear is the primary cause of foot ulceration in patients who have systemic disease, such as diabetes, with 20% of presenting ulcers being due to shoes rubbing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It has been shown that diabetic foot ulcerations are largely preventable when using custom off-loading footwear with ulcer recurrence rates found to decrease by 53% over a year follow up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Re-ulceration rates were found to be 26% among therapeutic footwear group and 83% among those who wore their own footwear in ischemic and neuropathic ulcers, from a cohort of 386 ulcerations presented in clinic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Off-loading pressure is therefore indispensable for stopping the potential progression of pre-ulcerative conditions toward lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Although feet with significant deformities or delineated as high risk are recommended by NICE to be referred for bespoke footwear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], there is a high dissatisfaction with prescription footwear to the point of not wearing them and they invariably become just another pair of &#x0201c;shoes in the cupboard&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The lack of use of prescription footwear has been associated with the size, weight, design, comfort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], lack of choice and styles of the shoes prescribed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Although improved styling and newer materials used within the off-the-shelf medical-grade footwear (M-GF) has helped to increase compliance in wearing the shoe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], there is still a lack of empirical data to support the use of these shoes for pressure reduction on the dorsum of the foot.</p><p>Therefore, this aims to explore the use of off-the-shelf medical-grade footwear as a pressure relieving intervention. Dorsal digital and interdigital forefoot pressure when wearing an off-the-shelf M-GF and the participants own footwear will be compared. Additionally, the comfort perception of both shoes will be assessed to evaluate if there is a difference between off the shelf M-GF and participants&#x02019; own footwear.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Thirty participants (18 females, 12 males) from a convenience sample of routine podiatry patients with an average age of 71.4&#x000a0;years (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;75.7, F&#x02009;=&#x02009;68.5), height of 1.64&#x000a0;m (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.7, F&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.61), weight of 78.9&#x000a0;kg (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;83.22, F&#x02009;=&#x02009;74.34) and shoe size of 7 (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;8.5, F&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) were recruited from a UK private podiatry clinic.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Footwear choice is often made on comfort and activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Changing footwear habits can be difficult and perceptions of ill-fitting footwear contributing to pressure related toe problems are still not fully accepted. The results from this study indicate that the use of off-the-shelf medial grade footwear (M-GF) can significantly improve comfort and in addition reduce dorsal toe pressures in a clinical population.</p><p>M-GF were ranked most comfortable in all of the defined nine footwear characteristics and were in line with previous work which attest that the design, construction and properties of footwear are important factors in footwear comfort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The high comfort point for the ball of foot and heel cushioning are attributed to the M-GF&#x02019;s lightweight cushioning polyeurethane sole, the removable flat 4&#x000a0;mm foam spacer and cushioning gel insole 7&#x000a0;mm thick under the forefoot, not always seen in routine footwear purchased from the high street. These structural features could be important to define clinical advice for comfortable footwear when ill-fitting footwear is chosen.</p><p>Footwear length was the most significant comfortable feature scored for participants from this podiatry practice, for each shoe condition indicating that the length of the shoe was well matched to foot size. It is thought that to obtain a good fit from a shoe that a distance of 1&#x000a0;cm is required at the end of the toe to allow for elongation during the gait cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This has particular implications to lesser toe deformities which are associated with wearing shoes shorter than the foot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Additionally wearing incorrect shoe length has been associated with foot, back pain and general biomechanical imbalance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although the participants own shoes were not measured, fitting of the M-GF shoe did include a foot sizing match. The differences in footwear comfort could have therefore been related to an improved fit from the M-GF shoe.</p><p>Footwear comfort perception is largely subjective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], tactile, visual, auditory and olfactory sensations are involved in comfortable shoes selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Despite initial concerns that the appearance and style of the intervention footwear may have resulted in negative perception of comfort and ultimately in low comfort scoring, participants appeared to exercise a high degree of objectivity in scoring, such that these factors did not adversely affects their scoring. This finding concurs with Williams et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] that simply improving the appearance of shoes will improve patient compliance. Indeed it is possible that compliance may be improved by convincing patients to view therapeutic footwear as a prescription in a similar manner as the pharmacologic agents prescribed for medical needs.</p><p>Changing the perceptions of patients into believing that altering footwear style could improve pressure related foot problems is ongoing. It is clear from this study that the M-GF significantly altered all 3 pressure variables compared to the participants own footwear. However, it is not clear whether the participants&#x02019; own footwear was initially creating a pressure related foot problem that needed reducing. It is still unknown as to specific conditions for callus and other hyperkeratotic lesions to form. Yet, footwear shape has been identified as limiting foot function with the fifth toes often forced to adapt to the confined area of the toe box of footwear thus subjecting them to friction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Similarly, toe box volume can compromise toe position and a wider forefoot has been correlated with ill-fitting footwear and pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>The shape of the toe box is also important when considering pressure reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The variance in shaping of the toe box allowed for a rounder wider toe box to be observed in the M-GF shoe over the participants own shoe. This altered shaping could explain why the difference in pressure, between the M-GF and participants own shoe, was reduced more at the sensors located on the medial and lateral borders of the foot rather than the sensors placed in between toes. There is some suggestion that the medial and lateral borders of the foot are the most frequent sites of foot pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This may however be due to the unique mechanics of the joint mechanisms of the 1<sup>st</sup> ray and the lateral column [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Yet, if dysfunction in foot mechanics exists in an individual the addition of ill-fitting footwear could exacerbate pressure related problems.</p><p>The limitations of this study include the potential for bias by not blinding the researcher or participant to footwear condition as this may have influenced subjective scoring. Similarly, comfort ratings of the shoes were recorded on the day of testing after only a brief familiarisation period therefore the results presented may not be considered an accurate indicator of the degree of comfort over longer periods of wear. The distribution of data between participants showed great variability leading to large standard deviations and an uneven spread across variables. Increasing the sample size could have rectified this error and should be considered for future work. Furthermore, this study could be a useful premise for the development of a larger scale structured clinical trial to explore the material properties and the construction of the shoe in relation to pathology. Future research would benefit from analysing the effects of the footwear on participant&#x02019;s specific foot pathologies, anatomical variations, gait patterns, velocity and body weight.</p><p>Introducing M-GF in place of own footwear as an intervention for digital pressure related lesions will reduce the digital pressure and improve comfort. This type of footwear should be considered as part of a relevant treatment plan when discussing footwear choice with individuals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>There is minimal research on the efficacy of appropriate non-bespoke pressure relieving footwear which clinicians can introduce to patients to purchase with confidence. Footwear catalogues such as Dr Comfort&#x000ae; are routinely given as part of a footwear advice with no structured research to support the use of the shoes. This study provides evidence to the efficacy of one style from the Dr Comfort&#x000ae; M-GF range which can be included in footwear advice protocols.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>Please contact author for data requests.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>BH conducted this study as part of her MSc Clinical Biomechanics at Staffordshire University, she developed the research design and conducted all data collection and made the initial draft of the manuscript.
