However, the review concluded that the quality of evidence was low due to poor reporting of study methods and possible publication bias.</p></sec><sec id="dex227s4"><title>STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION</title><p>This double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) included 159 participants between April 2007 and June 2014. Subjects were randomly allocated to either CC (<italic>n</italic> = 79) or letrozole (<italic>n</italic> = 80) in a 1:1 ratio. Both drugs were encapsulated to look identical. Randomization was performed in mixed blocks and stratified by patients&#x02019; BMI (&#x0003c;30 and 30&#x02013;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="dex227s5" sec-type="methods"><title>PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS</title><p>The trial included subfertile women diagnosed with PCOS. Treatment started with one tablet (CC 50 mg, letrozole 2.5 mg) increasing to two in non-responders and continuing until pregnancy or for up to six ovulatory cycles. Non-responders were crossed over to the other treatment after a 6-week break. Cycles were initially monitored with ultrasound follicle tracking then mid-luteal serum progesterone measurement in subsequent cycles.</p></sec><sec id="dex227s6" sec-type="results"><title>MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE</title><p>Amongst the 159 participants included in the intention-to-treat analysis, four women conceived before treatment and six were lost-to-follow-up. The remaining 149 participants (74 on CC and 75 on letrozole) completed at least the first treatment. Women receiving letrozole achieved a significantly (<italic>P</italic> = 0.022; absolute difference [95% confidence interval] 18% [3&#x02013;33%]) higher pregnancy rate (61.%) than those on CC (43%). The median number of treatment cycles received until pregnancy was significantly (log rank <italic>P</italic> = 0.038) smaller with letrozole (4[3&#x02013;5] cycles) compared to CC (6[4&#x02013;7] cycles). LB rates were not statistically (<italic>P</italic> = 0.089) different between the two groups, although there was a trend towards higher rates on letrozole (48.8%) compared to CC (35.4%). After the crossover, pregnancy and LB rates on letrozole (<italic>n</italic> = 45; 28.9 and 24.4%, respectively) were not statistically (<italic>P</italic> = 0.539 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.601) different from CC (<italic>n</italic> = 31; 22.6 and 19.4%).</p></sec><sec id="dex227s7"><title>LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION</title><p>One possible limitation of this trial may be the exclusion of PCOS women with BMI &#x0003e; 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, which would limit the applicability of the results in this subgroup of PCOS. However, this group of women are generally excluded from treatment in the majority of fertility centres, especially in Europe, due to the associated challenges and risks.</p></sec><sec id="dex227s8"><title>WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS</title><p>The results of this trial are consistent with the recent Cochrane systematic review. However, with its robust design, the current RCT provides more valid and compelling evidence for the superiority of letrozole over CC as a primary ovulation induction agent in PCOS women with 40% increase in pregnancy rates and with a shorter time-to-pregnancy. Furthermore, the participants in this RCT are a good representation of subfertile PCOS population receiving fertility treatment in Europe and worldwide. The results are therefore globally generalizable for clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="dex227s9"><title>STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S)</title><p>This RCT was mainly funded by the R&#x00026;D Funding Scheme of Derby Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. The study also received funds from School of Medicine, University of Nottingham. The Trust R&#x00026;D department was involved in the development of the protocol and the running of the trial. The trial was sponsored and monitored by the University of Nottingham. The authors have no conflicts of interest.</p></sec><sec id="dex227s10"><title>TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER</title><p>

For decades, clomiphene citrate (CC) has been the standard first line ovulation induction (OI) agent in PCOS women with ovulation rates of ~85% and pregnancy rates of 35&#x02013;40% (<xref rid="dex227C4" ref-type="bibr">Dickey and Holtkamp, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="dex227C9" ref-type="bibr">Kousta <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="dex227C6" ref-type="bibr">Imani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). This discrepancy between ovulation and conception rates has been attributed to the peripheral anti-oestrogenic actions of CC on endometrial development and cervical mucus (<xref rid="dex227C13" ref-type="bibr">Massai <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="dex227C16" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Letrozole, a specific aromatase inhibitor that reduces oestrogen synthesis, has recently been considered as a potentially better alternative to CC. In contrast to CC, letrozole is not associated with any anti-oestrogenic effects on endometrium. This is supported by recent studies reporting adequate endometrial thickness during letrozole treatment (<xref rid="dex227C15" ref-type="bibr">Mitwally and Casper, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="dex227C1" ref-type="bibr">Al-Omari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="dex227C3" ref-type="bibr">Atay <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, unlike CC that accumulates in the body because of its long half-life (2 weeks), letrozole is rapidly eliminated due to its short half-life (45 h), leading to late follicular rise in circulating oestrogen thereby enhancing endometrial development with subsequent increase in the chances of pregnancy (<xref rid="dex227C12" ref-type="bibr">Lipton <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="dex227C20" ref-type="bibr">Sioufi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="dex227C23" ref-type="bibr">Young <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). The rising oestrogen levels may also result in a shorter FSH window (mimicking the physiological cycle) with subsequent mono-ovulation and a lower risk of multiple pregnancy.</p><p>
<xref rid="dex227C5" ref-type="bibr">Franik <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref> published a Cochrane systematic review of clinical trials comparing aromatase inhibitors versus CC. They concluded that the quality of evidence in the reviewed trials was low due to poor reporting of study methods and possible publication bias. One of the trials in that review, which had a good design, included a high proportion of markedly obese women (BMI &#x0003e;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), which does not reflect clinical practice in the majority of fertility centres worldwide (<xref rid="dex227C11" ref-type="bibr">Legro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). These results are therefore neither conclusive nor generalizable. The Cochrane review authors stated that further research is needed to compare letrozole with CC as a primary OI agent in PCOS women. Furthermore, none of the reviewed trials was conducted in Europe. Geographical, ethnic, genetic and phenotypical differences in PCOS as well as differences in clinical practices in different parts of the world may limit the generalizability of the review findings in Europe. Therefore, the effectiveness of letrozole versus CC remains uncertain.</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that letrozole as a primary OI agent will generate higher pregnancy rates than CC in anovulatory women with PCOS. The purpose of the crossover design, was to test the efficacy of each drug as a secondary OI agent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="dex227s14"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="dex227s14a"><title>Trial design</title><p>This was a single centre, two-arm double-blind RCT.

Eligible participants were women aged 18&#x02013;39 years with BMI &#x02264;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, anovulatory infertility, and a diagnosis of PCOS based on Rotterdam consensus (two of three criteria: oligo-/anovulation, hyperandrogenaemia and sonographic appearance of polycystic ovaries) (<xref rid="dex227C18" ref-type="bibr">Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM-sponsored PCOS consensus workshop group, 2004</xref>). Diagnosis of oligo-/anovulation was based on a menstrual pattern of oligo-/amenorrhoea (cycle &#x0003e;35 days) and/or a low mid-luteal serum progesterone concentration. Hyperandrogenaemia was diagnosed either clinically (acne/hirsutism) or biochemically (testosterone &#x02265;2.5 nmol/l or free androgen index [FAI] &#x02265;5). Ultrasound criteria included &#x02265;12 follicles (2&#x02013;9 mm) and/or an ovarian volume of &#x0003e;10 ml (<xref rid="dex227C8" ref-type="bibr">Jonard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). All participants had proven patency of at least one fallopian tube and normal semen analysis of their male partners (<xref rid="dex227C22" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 1999</xref>). We excluded patients who have received OI within 6 months and those with uncontrolled thyroid disease or hyperprolactinaemia. Patients with marked hyperandrogenaemia were screened for adult onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia (by measuring serum 17-&#x003b1;-hydroxyl-progesterone concentration) and Cushing syndrome (by measuring urinary free cortisol).</p></sec><sec id="dex227s14c"><title>Interventions</title><p>Letrozole and CC were prescribed (by the senior investigator, SA) orally daily for 5 days starting on Days 2&#x02013;4 of a menstrual period or a progestogen-induced bleed (medroxy-progesterone acetate 10 mg twice daily for 5 days). The starting dose was one tablet/day (letrozole 2.5 mg or CC 50 mg) and if ovulation was not achieved, the dose would be doubled in the second cycle. Ovulation was initially monitored by ultrasound follicle tracking (performed by an independent qualified sonographer) and mid-luteal (cycle Day 21 &#x000b1; 2) serum progesterone measurement. Ovulation was diagnosed with a progesterone level of &#x02265;25 nmol/l, a follicle diameter &#x02265;17 mm and/or occurrence of pregnancy (positive urinary hCG and ultrasound detection of gestational sac). Once ovulation was achieved, further cycles would be monitored mainly by serum progesterone levels with follicle tracking as an option. In case of no ovulation and if the participant remained amenorrheic for &#x02265;6 weeks, bleeding would be induced with progestogen treatment (as above). All participants were advised about timed intercourse during the treatment cycles. Treatment continued until pregnancy or for up to six ovulatory cycles. Participants who failed to ovulate on the maximum dose (two tablets) or to conceive after six ovulatory cycles were crossed over to the other drug (after a 6-week wash-out period) following the same procedures as with the first drug. The obstetric records of those conceiving were reviewed for pregnancy outcomes.</p><p>During the course of treatment, if ovulation stopped after an initial positive response, the dose was increased in the subsequent cycle; if already on the high dose, the participant was crossed over to the second drug; or the study was ended if already on the second medicine. The maximum number of cycles per treatment remained seven.</p></sec><sec id="dex227s14d"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome was clinical pregnancy (diagnosed by ultrasonographic visualization of a gestational sac) rate per patient on primary treatment (before the crossover). Secondary outcomes included ovulation, live-birth (LB), pregnancy per ovulating patient, pregnancy per strata, mono-ovulation, endometrial development (thickness and grades), pregnancy outcome and pregnancy complications. Other outcomes included pregnancy and LB rates on secondary and overall (primary and secondary) treatments.</p></sec><sec id="dex227s14e"><title>Endometrial grades</title><p>Mid-cycle endometrial pattern was assessed and classified into three grades A, B and C according to <xref rid="dex227C25" ref-type="bibr">Zhao <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref>. Grade A endometrium has a triple-line pattern, characterized by three hyperechogenic lines (a central and two outer lines) separated by two hypoechogenic areas. Grade C endometrium has a homogenous (non-triple line) hyperechogenic appearance. Grade B endometrium has an intermediate pattern with a poorly defined central echogenic line surrounded by iso- or hypoechogenic layers.</p></sec><sec id="dex227s14f"><title>Sample size</title><p>To detect a clinically significant difference of 20% between the previously reported pregnancy rate of CC (~35%) and letrozole with a two-sided 5% significance level and power of 80%, a sample size of 212 participants (106 per arm) was required (<xref rid="dex227C4" ref-type="bibr">Dickey and Holtkamp, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="dex227C9" ref-type="bibr">Kousta <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="dex227C6" ref-type="bibr">Imani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). In view of the lack of literature data on letrozole before this trial, it was pre-planned in the protocol to perform an interim analysis during the trial with a view to re-calculating the sample size based on the obtained data. An interim blind analysis of the primary outcome after 50% recruitment (<italic>n</italic> = 106) revealed pregnancy rates of 41.5 and 64.2% for drug A (CC) and B (letrozole), respectively (<italic>P</italic> = 0.020, rate ratio [RR] 1.5 [1.1&#x02013;2.3]; absolute difference [AD] 23% [4&#x02013;40%]). Although, the difference was statistically significant, the power of the study was only 65%. Based on these data, the sample size was recalculated as 75 participants per arm to achieve 80% power with a two-sided 5% significance level. We aimed to recruit 160 participants to allow for 5% drop-outs.</p></sec><sec id="dex227s14g"><title>Randomization</title><p>An independent pharmacist randomly allocated participants to letrozole or CC, in 1:1 ratio according to a randomization list created by the trial statistician using NQuery Advisor v6.0 software. Randomization was stratified by patients&#x02019; BMI (non-obese &#x0003c;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and obese 30&#x02013;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) using mixed block sizes. The randomization list included the patient study number and the treatment code (A or B). The participant study number was indicated on the prescription and used by the pharmacist to determine the allocated treatment. Investigators, patients, outcome assessors and the statistician were blinded to the allocation of participants.</p></sec><sec id="dex227s14h"><title>Blinding</title><p>Letrozole 2.5 mg Tablets (Femara<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd) and CC 50 mg Tablets (Clomid<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Sanofi UK) were encapsulated in identical opaque capsules by ML(IMP)-licensed Pharmacy Production Units (initially Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield UK and later St Mary's Pharmaceutical Unit Cardiff and Vale University LHB, Cardiff, UK).</p><p>The capsules were packed in identical bottles of five capsules, which were labelled in accordance with Annex 13 of the Rules and Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Distributors. The packs were supplied to the Pharmacy Department, Royal Derby Hospital with additional labels allowing the Pharmacy Staff to identify the contents. At the time of dispensing to the participant these identifiers were removed. While the Pharmacy staff were aware of the patient's allocated treatment throughout the study, the patients and all investigators, including clinicians, research nurses, sonographers and the statistician remained blinded to the treatment. The Pharmacy Department had procedures in place to allow the treatment for any participant to be unblinded at any time in case of emergency. Unblinding was necessary in one case who developed a skin rash, suspected to be a reaction to the trial drug, and she was withdrawn from the study (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dex227F1">1</xref>). Further assessment of the rash excluded any reaction to the trial medicine.

We have found letrozole to generate a pregnancy rate of 61%, which is 40% (RR, 1.4) higher than that (43%) of the standard first line CC in anovulatory women with PCOS. Furthermore, letrozole also resulted in a 40% (RR, 1.4) increase in the LB rate compared to CC (49 versus 35%, respectively), although this did not reach statistical significance as the study was not powered to address this outcome (power 36%, alpha level 0.05). We also found that letrozole has significantly shortened the time-to-pregnancy compared to CC (four versus six treatment cycles, respectively). In addition, we have reported relatively low pregnancy rates on both drugs as secondary treatments (after the crossover). This finding suggests a cross-resistance between the two drugs. The incidence of twins with letrozole (6%) was not different from the previously published 5&#x02013;10% incidence of CC twins (<xref rid="dex227C19" ref-type="bibr">Scialli, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="dex227C7" ref-type="bibr">Imani <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). There were no differences in the other pregnancy outcomes, but the trial was not powered to assess these parameters. These data should therefore be considered preliminary.</p><p>Our PCOS participants fulfilled the universally accepted Rotterdam diagnostic criteria of PCOS and had a median BMI of ~27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. We believe that this cohort is a good representation of PCOS women receiving fertility treatment in most fertility centres. Our results are therefore globally generalizable for clinical practice.</p><p>Our data are consistent with the recent Cochrane systematic review, which reported 44% higher pregnancy rates with the letrozole compared to CC alone with no adjuvants (OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.20&#x02013;1.73, <italic>n</italic> = 2286) (<xref rid="dex227C5" ref-type="bibr">Franik <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). However, the quality of evidence presented in that review was deemed poor by the review authors as most of the trials were neither randomized nor double blinded. The only well-designed trial by <xref rid="dex227C11" ref-type="bibr">Legro <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref> had a selection bias towards markedly obese PCOS women, with two-thirds of their cohort having BMI &#x0003e;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (one-third over 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). This may explain their significantly lower pregnancy and LB rates compared to our trial. They, however, reported (graphically) cumulative LB data in 250 non-obese women (BMI &#x02264;30.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) showing no significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.39) difference between the two drugs. Although we have also found no statistically significant difference in LB rates in non-obese women, our results showed an obvious trend towards markedly higher LB rates with letrozole (53%) compared to CC (37%) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="dex227TB4">II</xref>). In contrast, the difference in Legro's trial was only small in favour of letrozole. It is worth mentioning, however, that both Legro's trial and ours are underpowered for this outcome in non-obese PCOS women.</p><p>As far as time-to-pregnancy and multiple pregnancy data are concerned, our findings seem to differ from those of Legro's trial. However, this could simply be due to lack of sufficient statistical power to assess these outcomes in either of our trials (<xref rid="dex227C11" ref-type="bibr">Legro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Our letrozole safety data are consistent with several previous studies showing no increase in fetal/neonatal anomalies in letrozole pregnancies (<xref rid="dex227C21" ref-type="bibr">Tulandi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="dex227C11" ref-type="bibr">Legro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p><p>With regards to endometrial parameters, mid-cycle endometrium was slightly thicker with CC compared to letrozole. However, this difference is unlikely to affect the chances of pregnancy. Although endometrial thickness and pattern have been widely utilized as markers of endometrial receptivity, more recent research does not support their usefulness (<xref rid="dex227C25" ref-type="bibr">Zhao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Our endometrial data therefore neither support nor exclude an endometrial factor for the differences in pregnancy rates between the two drugs.</p><p>A possible explanation of the higher success of letrozole is the greater ovulation rate per cycle in the letrozole group. <xref rid="dex227C11" ref-type="bibr">Legro <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref> hypothesized that the higher pregnancy rate with letrozole could be due to lower mid-luteal serum estradiol level and higher progesterone levels (probably due to sustained aromatase inhibition into the luteal phase) (<xref rid="dex227C19" ref-type="bibr">Scialli, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="dex227C4" ref-type="bibr">Dickey and Holtkamp, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="dex227C7" ref-type="bibr">Imani <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="dex227C10" ref-type="bibr">Legro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="dex227C11" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>It may be argued that excluding women with BMI &#x0003e;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> could limit the applicability of our results in obese women. However, the majority of fertility centres worldwide, especially in Europe, tend to exclude markedly obese women from fertility treatment due to the well-known associated challenges and risks (<xref rid="dex227C24" ref-type="bibr">Zachariah <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Another possible limitation of this RCT may be argued to be using pregnancy rather than LB as the primary outcome. However, we believe that pregnancy rate is clinically important and relevant and is commonly used in practice. A further slight concern is the long duration of the trial spanning over a 7-year period with potential differences in responses between the early and late recruits. However, the results of the interim analysis, which included the early recruits, are consistent with the final results.</p><p>In conclusion, this trial provides compelling evidence for the superiority of letrozole over clomiphene citrate as a primary OI agent in PCOS women with a 40% increase in pregnancy rates and with a shorter time-to-pregnancy. We, therefore, recommend that letrozole should replace CC as the first line OI agent in PCOS. Further research is required to investigate possible mechanisms of the increased pregnancy rates with letrozole and of the cross-resistance between the two drugs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="dex227s17"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>
