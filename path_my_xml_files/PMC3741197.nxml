Little is known about the cost-effectiveness of pharmacist's interventions aimed at improving adherence to antidepressants. The study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a community pharmacist intervention in comparison with usual care in depressed patients initiating treatment with antidepressants in primary care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients were recruited by general practitioners and randomized to community pharmacist intervention (87) that received an educational intervention and usual care (92). Adherence to antidepressants, clinical symptoms, Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs), use of healthcare services and productivity losses were measured at baseline, 3 and 6 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were no significant differences between groups in costs or effects. From a societal perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the community pharmacist intervention compared with usual care was &#x020ac;1,866 for extra adherent patient and &#x020ac;9,872 per extra QALY. In terms of remission of depressive symptoms, the usual care dominated the community pharmacist intervention. If willingness to pay (WTP) is &#x020ac;30,000 per extra adherent patient, remission of symptoms or QALYs, the probability of the community pharmacist intervention being cost-effective was 0.71, 0.46 and 0.75, respectively (societal perspective). From a healthcare perspective, the probability of the community pharmacist intervention being cost-effective in terms of adherence, QALYs and remission was of 0.71, 0.76 and 0.46, respectively, if WTP is &#x020ac;30,000.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A brief community pharmacist intervention addressed to depressed patients initiating antidepressant treatment showed a probability of being cost-effective of 0.71 and 0.75 in terms of improvement of adherence and QALYs, respectively, when compared to usual care. Regular implementation of the community pharmacist intervention is not recommended.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00794196?term=NCT00794196">NCT00794196</ext-link>

Major depression also imposes a substantial financial burden on society through increased health care utilization and absenteeism from paid work <xref rid="pone.0070588-Sobocki1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>The cost associated with mental disorders currently accounts for approximately 3%&#x02013;4% of gross domestic product in Europe <xref rid="pone.0070588-Commission1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In Catalonia, a Spanish region with a population of around 7.5 million inhabitants, the annual cost of major depression in 2006 was 735 million Euros <xref rid="pone.0070588-SalvadorCarulla1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.

Some efforts have concentrated on pharmacists, in their role of drug dispensers and specialists on medication showing a positive effect on adherence to antidepressants <xref rid="pone.0070588-RubioValera2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The PRODEFAR study was focused on a community pharmacist's intervention in depressed patients <xref rid="pone.0070588-RubioValera3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The pharmacist intervention being evaluated showed to impact positively on patients' health-related quality of life and the impact on the levels of adherence to antidepressants was almost statistically significant in the per protocol analysis. The severity of depressive symptoms was not affected by the intervention <xref rid="pone.0070588-RubioValera3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>Economic evaluations provide decision-makers with information on how to allocate the limited resources available for health care. However, only one study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a pharmacist's intervention to improve adherence to antidepressants <xref rid="pone.0070588-Bosmans1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The study considered a small sample size both in the main analysis (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;88) and in the per protocol analysis (only 26 patients in the intervention group). Besides, this study did not include quality adjusted life years (QALY) as a measure of effectiveness thus limiting comparison with other therapies and therapeutic areas <xref rid="pone.0070588-Glick1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a community pharmacist intervention (CPI) in comparison with usual care (UC) for depressed patient initiating treatment with antidepressants in primary care.

The study protocol was approved by the Fundaci&#x000f3; Ethics Committee. Patients signed an informed consent to participate.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Study population</title><p>Participants were recruited in 4 Primary Care Health Centres (30 GPs) from two cities (Gav&#x000e0; and El Prat) in the metropolitan area of Barcelona (1 October 2008&#x02013;31 May 2011). At first, only the PCHC from Gav&#x000e0; participated in the study but to accelerate patient inclusion, a population from El Prat was included in March 2010. Eligible patients were adults aged 18&#x02013;75 initiating treatment with antidepressants because of depression. Depression was assessed using the research version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I) <xref rid="pone.0070588-First1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070588-First2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. GPs were blind to the DSM-IV diagnosis and patient inclusion was performed according to their usual practice.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Randomization</title><p>Randomization was done at the patient level using a computerized random-number generator following a permuted block design. Every GP received a set of 10 sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes containing patient assignment. The GP sequentially stapled one of the envelopes to the patient's prescription that was opened by the pharmacist in the community pharmacy. Pharmacists were asked to be careful not to use intervention elements in their contacts with the UC group. Patients were asked to avoid conversations concerning the study with other participating patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interventions</title><p>Patients received the CPI when they went to the pharmacy to pick up their first prescription of antidepressants (mean time invested of 14.4 minutes). A shorter version of the intervention was used as a reminder when patients refilled their prescriptions (mean time invested of 7.7 minutes). The CPI consisted of an educational intervention provided by the pharmacist and focused on improving patients' knowledge of antidepressant medication, as well as making patients aware of the importance of compliance to the medication, to reassure the patient about possible side-effects, and to stress the importance of carrying out GPs' advice. Also, in patients with a sceptical attitude towards antidepressants, the intervention aimed to reduce stigma. Pharmacists participating in the study were trained for the intervention.</p><p>Patients in the UC group received usual care from their GP and pharmacist. The intervention in the usual care group consisted of filling the prescriptions, addressing patients' questions about medication and giving basic advice about how to take the antidepressant. Pharmacists invested a mean of 7.8 minutes per patient for the first visit and 7.7 minutes for subsequent visits.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Clinical outcomes</title><p>Adherence was measured using electronic pharmacy records. Every time the patient refills his/her medication the system automatically registers the information in the patient's clinical history. This method for assessing adherence provides a good estimate of adherence and has been recommended both in research and clinical contexts <xref rid="pone.0070588-Hansen1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>Originally, the intention was for pharmacists to manually register the information on medication dispensed. However, the electronic system was much more reliable and easy to execute and was not affected by the mobility of the patients or the loss to follow-up. The medication possession ratio (MPR) was calculated as (Number of doses refilled/Number of doses prescribed)*100. Some patients abandoned the treatment right after commencement and, after some months without treatment, suffered a relapse and initiated a new treatment. In some cases, the amount of antidepressant drugs refilled by those patients, if we took into account the whole 6-months, period was over the 80%. Consequently, continuity in the acquisition of medication was also checked. Patients were considered to have a drug gap if there was a period of 2 or more months without medication. Poor adherence was defined as having a MPR&#x0003c;80% or having a medication gap <xref rid="pone.0070588-Peterson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>QALYs and severity of depression were assessed at baseline, and 3 and 6 months of follow-up.</p><p>Health-related quality of life was measured using the EuroQol-5D <xref rid="pone.0070588-The1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0070588-Badia2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and Spanish tariffs were used to estimate the utility of health states described by the patients <xref rid="pone.0070588-Dolan1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. QALYs were calculated by multiplying the utility with the amount of time a patient spent in a particular health state. Linear interpolation was used for transitions between health states.</p><p>Severity of depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item depression module (PHQ-9) <xref rid="pone.0070588-Spitzer1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070588-Kroenke1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Remission of symptoms was considered as having a reduction in PHQ-9 scores superior to 50% <xref rid="pone.0070588-Khin1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Service utilization and cost measures</title><p>Cost data were collected from a societal perspective at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Use of health care resources and lost productivity were assessed with the Client Service Receipt Inventory with a three months recall period <xref rid="pone.0070588-Knapp1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Information about use of psychotropic drugs was collected from computerized pharmacy records. Intervention costs were estimated using the patient study chart kept by the pharmacist. Pharmacists registered the time spend with the CPI and UC patients in each visit to the pharmacy.</p><p>A secondary analysis was done from a health system perspective (indirect costs excluded).</p><p>Direct healthcare costs comprised visits to publicly and privately funded primary and secondary care providers, hospitalisation, tests, and drugs. The Official Bulletin of the Catalan Government for 2009 was used to estimate the costs of publicly funded services <xref rid="pone.0070588-Resolution1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. For privately funded services, we used the information provided by the Official College of Physicians of Barcelona <xref rid="pone.0070588-Official1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>Indirect costs consisted of the costs of absenteeism from paid work. Costs of work loss were calculated by multiplying the days on sick leave with the minimum daily wage in Spain according to the human capital approach <xref rid="pone.0070588-Spanish1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>The unit cost of the community pharmacists was calculated taking into account the pharmacists annum working time as well as general community pharmacy expenses, pharmacists salaries and salaries on costs, taxes and pharmacists annum working time. This information was extracted from a published annual report based on income tax return declarations from Spanish community pharmacies in 2009 <xref rid="pone.0070588-ASPIME1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>In the CPI group extra costs were included to account for the time spent on the training by the pharmacists. Training costs were estimated by adding the tariffs of the Official College of Pharmacists from Barcelona for similar training courses with the time spent by the pharmacists on the training and taking into account the 12-month incidence of depression in primary care Catalan population.</p><p>

The imputation model included important sociodemographic and prognostic variables associated with the outcome variables and drop-outs (education and presence of depression according to DSM-IV criteria).

Total costs were higher in the CPI group, mainly as a consequence of increased costs in productivity losses. Cost-effectiveness planes and CEACs showed that a brief CPI had a probability of only 0.71 and 0.75 in terms of improvement of adherence and QALY, respectively, of being cost-effective when compared to UC. The CPI was unlikely to be cost-effective in comparison with UC in terms of remission of symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Comparison with previous findings</title><p>Until now, to the best of our knowledge, only one study has been published on the cost-effectiveness of a pharmacist intervention for depression <xref rid="pone.0070588-RubioValera3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Bosmans et al conducted a randomized controlled trial in The Netherlands in which a pharmacist intervention plus a take-home educational videotape were compared to UC for patients with depression initiating treatment with antidepressants. Bosmans and colleagues found no impact of the intervention on the improvement of adherence or clinical symptoms of depression. In their study, total costs were slightly higher in the intervention group but the difference was not statistically significant. As was the case in the present study, in the study by Bosmans et al indirect costs accounted for most of the difference in total costs between groups, although the difference between groups in indirect costs was not statistically significant.</p><p>Bosmans et al found little evidence supporting the cost-effectiveneness of a brief educative pharmacist intervention into clinical practice, which is consistent with the results observed in the present paper.</p><p>Schoenbaum and colleagues evaluated the impact of support medication adherence program that was implemented via the telephone by trained practice nurses <xref rid="pone.0070588-Schoenbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. In this study, the intervention group generated higher costs but differences were not statistically significant. No statistically significant differences in QALYs were observed between the intervention and UC groups and ICER was &#x020ac;37,422 (adjusted to 2009 Euros). This result is in line with the results presented in the present paper showing that in terms of QALYs, low intensity educative interventions implemented by community pharmacists are not cost-effective in comparison with UC when dealing with depressed patients who start antidepressant treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Economic evaluations are highly affected by sampling uncertainty. Size calculation was based on the improvement in adherence to antidepressants and the study could have been underpowered to detect differences in the cost-effectiveness analysis. However, to the best of our knowledge, our study has the largest sample size used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a pharmacist intervention in depressed patients.</p><p>Second, patients in the intervention and control group attended the same community pharmacies and contamination of the control group could have occurred. This could have been prevented by performing a cluster randomization at the pharmacy level. To minimise the impact of this contamination, pharmacists were asked to be aware of contamination when attending patients in the UC instead than at the patient level group and patients were asked not to share information with other patients participating in the study.</p><p>Third, the GPs that participated in the study could have had a special interest in the topic under study and could have routinely conducted interventions to improve patients' adherence to antidepressants. Although this would have affected both UC and CPI groups, it could have limited the margin of improvement of the pharmacist intervention.</p><p>Fourth, a follow-up period of 6 months may be too short to be able to evaluate long term costs and effects of the intervention such as relapse of depression. Higher rates of adherence have been associated to a lower risk of relapse which could reduce the costs <xref rid="pone.0070588-Geddes1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>An important strength is that this was a naturalistic study with very wide inclusion criterion, which was conducted in two different populations and where the intervention was implemented by many different community pharmacists. This increases the generalisability of the results while this also could have introduced heterogeneity. The proportion of men and women differed between groups and only half of the sample met DSM-IV criteria for major depression. However, with exception of the unadjusted analysis, all the models were controlled for gender and the presence of major depression was tested as an adjusting variable in all the models and included when necessary. Also, a sensitivity analysis of the patients that presented major depression according to DSM-IV criteria has been included. Moreover, patients could decide whether to refill their prescription and move from one to another pharmacy in successive visits. Consequently, 26% of the patients in the intervention group did not receive the intervention as allocated. However, we think that this is representative of daily clinical practice and that this greatly improves the generalisability of the results.</p><p>Finally, the main clinical outcome, adherence to antidepressants, was measured using electronic pharmacy records. Patients could have refilled prescription but not take them. However, this method has two advantages: patients are unaware of the fact that their adherence to medication is being observed and information can be collected even when patients drop-out from the study, avoiding missing data for our primary outcome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A brief CPI to improve adherence to antidepressants in patients initiating pharmacological treatment for depression, after 6 months follow-up, showed a maximum probability of being cost-effective of 0.71 and 0.75 in terms of improvement of adherence and QALY, respectively, when compared to UC. In view of the available evidence, we cannot recommend regular implementation of low intensity pharmacist interventions addressed to improve adherence to antidepressants in depressed patients.</p><p>The cost-effectiveness of more complex pharmacist's interventions needs to be evaluated before its implementation. In future studies, a longer follow-up period and the use of cluster randomization that limits contamination is recommended. Considering the uncertainty surrounding the costs in the sample size calculations is also necessary.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0070588.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
