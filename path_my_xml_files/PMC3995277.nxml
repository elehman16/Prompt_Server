The participants were 144 adults with chronic non-specific LBP. They were randomised to receive eight once-weekly treatments. Laser machines (20&#x02005;mW, 840&#x02005;nm diode, power density 0.1&#x02005;W/cm<sup>2</sup>) stimulated points in three treatment groups: sham (0 joules/point), low dose (0.2&#x02005;J/point) and high dose (0.8 joules/point). Participants were followed-up at 1 and 6&#x02005;weeks, and 6 and 12&#x02005;months post treatment. Primary outcomes were pain (Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)) and disability (Oswestry Disability Inventory (ODI)) at 6&#x02005;weeks post treatment. Secondary outcomes included numerical rating scale for limitation of activity, global assessment of improvement, analgesic usage and adverse effects after treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The analysis showed no difference between sham and the laser groups at 6&#x02005;weeks for pain or disability. There was a significant reduction in mean pain and disability in all groups at 6&#x02005;weeks (p&#x0003c;0.005); NPRS: sham (&#x02212;1.5 (95% CI &#x02212;2.1 to &#x02212;0.8)), low dose (&#x02212;1.3 (&#x02212;2.0 to &#x02212;0.8)), high dose (&#x02212;1.1 (&#x02212;1.7 to &#x02212;0.5)).

<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> There has been criticism that the effect of laser therapy in painful conditions is only a placebo effect<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> especially as there is still lack of an obvious mechanism&#x02014;particularly given lack of sensation during laser treatment. Despite this, there is some experimental evidence of low-level laser inducing anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, central nervous and lymphatic effects.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;12</xref></p><p>Low-level laser stimulation of acupuncture points (LA), using laser emitter devices applied to skin as an alternative to needles, has been commonly used in the last 35&#x02005;years. Although LA is a subgroup of LLLT, it is considered a separate form of treatment. Instead of using the direct effect of light on tissues to initiate a physiological response, the selection of points is based on a diagnostic and therapeutic paradigm defined by acupuncture theories.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Laser machines in the lower power output range are commonly used and anecdotally beneficial results have been reported.</p><p>Non-specific chronic low back pain (LBP) was targeted for study as it is common (prevalence of approximately 23%)<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and associated with significant disability, medical expenses and loss of productivity. It is also commonly treated with acupuncture. Evidence of efficacy for a non-drug, non-invasive treatment that could be used in primary care for this condition would be of great importance.</p><p>A position statement on LA by the Australian Medical Acupuncture College (AMAC) in 1995 stated that &#x02018;the optimal energy density for biostimulation, based on current clinical experience, is 4&#x02005;J/cm<sup>2</sup>&#x02019;.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> A review<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> examining trials of LA in a range of orthopaedic diseases was equivocal, but noted methodological drawbacks in the studies included. In another review<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> of the clinical effectiveness of LA, including eight trials on treatment of myofascial pain, Baxter concluded that &#x02018;laser acupuncture can be recommended as an effective treatment (moderate level of evidence) for the reduction of myofascial pain, at least when irradiation is applied at power of at least 10&#x02005;mW and a dosage of at least 0.5&#x02005;J/point&#x02019;.</p><p>Few randomised trials have specifically studied LA for treatment of chronic LBP compared to a sham laser control, and have not resolved issues of dose dependence for this condition. A small trial using an infrared laser (1.1&#x02005;J/point)<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> detected a significant improvement in only one of many pain outcomes measured. Subsequently, the results of another larger trial<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> using a 10&#x02005;mW infrared laser (0.2&#x02005;J/point) were negative, although questions were raised regarding the possibility of insufficient dosage<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and of confounding baseline factors.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> An adjusted analysis showed a benefit for this dose at 6&#x02005;weeks. It was considered important to perform another quality study resolving these issues with a three-arm design, including a higher dose within Baxter's recommended range and with long-term follow-up.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Subjects and methods</title><p>The study was a double-blind, prospective, three-group parallel randomised controlled trial, using sham laser in the control group with other arms using 0.2 and 0.8&#x02005;J of laser stimulation per point.

Participants were encouraged to attend a maximum of&#x000a0;eight sessions (one session a week for 8&#x02005;weeks) of 15&#x02005;min duration each. They continued with their usual therapies and analgesics according to their pain, but were requested not to start any acupuncture during the year of follow-up.</p><p>A pragmatic Western anatomical approach to acupuncture treatment was used, similar to the previous trial.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> At the start of each session participants were asked to note their average pain experienced during the previous week and indicate current distribution, and report any symptoms since the last treatment. Acupuncture point selection was individualised for each patient. Tender regional and more distal points along radiation pathways of pain were selected. Other acupuncture points depending on additional symptoms reported (eg, headache, other joint pain and psychological issues) were selected at the discretion of the therapist. The points were treated sequentially, with the laser probe resting perpendicularly and in light contact with the skin. No cointervention was used except for general support and information provided as part of each session (see online supplement 1).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The following measures were applied 1 and 6&#x02005;weeks, and 6 and 12&#x02005;months post treatment (immediate, short, intermediate and long-term follow-up).

Three machines were purpose built for the trial (Acupak, Melbourne, Australia) for concurrent use in a number of centres.

It found no difference in any outcome or adverse effects at any timepoint for LA in doses up to 0.8&#x02005;J/point (energy density 1&#x02013;4&#x02005;J/cm<sup>2</sup>) when compared with sham laser.</p><p>This trial strengthens the evidence for a lack of biological effect from laser at this low-dose range when treating chronic LBP. It also supports the influence of non-specific effects that may produce beneficial therapeutic outcomes in some patients, which otherwise may have been falsely attributed to the laser. A 30% PPC has previously been described as a clinically meaningful improvement.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In our whole cohort such non-specific effects resulted in a clinically important improvement approached in mean pain scores immediately following the last treatment, which persisted almost at the same level throughout follow-up. There was a smaller reduction in disability that was probably not clinically important.</p><p>A number of factors may have contributed to overall improvement after the intervention, including the placebo effect, the phenomenon of regression to the mean, natural history and effects simply from participating in an experiment (the Hawthorne effect). Some improvement may possibly have resulted from the acupressure-like effects of skin stimulation during examination for tender points.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>In the past LA trials have shown methodological limitations including small sample size, variable blinding and crossover designs. We applied a robust trial design to reduce risk of bias including gold standard randomisation and concealed allocation procedures for this type of research. Participants and therapists were successfully blinded to treatment allocation by using a specially designed device<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> ensuring masking the mode of laser emission. Although the duration of laser application to points was not masked, participants remained unaware of this treatment variable and were thus effectively &#x02018;blinded&#x02019;. Therapists who were aware, tended to stimulate larger numbers of points in subjects allocated the shorter-dose treatment. The total laser dose given in the low-dose arm was still one-third of the high-dose arm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ACUPMED2013010456TB1">table 1</xref>), allowing a meaningful investigation of dose dependence. Imputation approaches to manage missing data made no difference to the results. A preplanned, adjusted analysis showed that any baseline imbalance did not affect the primary result in the current trial.</p><p>This study had multiple exclusion criteria that may have reduced the external validity of this trial. This was informed by preceding research<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> excluding patients on disability support, regular users of any opioid and with previous back surgery or spinal injections. These groups previously demonstrated less improvement after intervention. Our intent was to maximise the chance of detecting a specific effect of laser stimulation, if it existed. A greater improvement in pain or disability was not observed in this trial, however. The reasons for this may have been an exercise cointervention, a larger number of treatment sessions and a higher mean baseline level of pain in the preceding study.</p><p>A large number of laser parameters available in treatment may make comparison between trials difficult to interpret. Different laser devices have different radiant power outputs and wavelengths ranging from the visible spectrum to infrared. Dose in joules per point and density of laser irradiation can also vary. Although this study examined the effect of infrared laser diodes using low energy densities for treating this condition, it is still possible that larger energy doses or different wavelengths may be more effective for chronic LBP. A much higher laser dose (8&#x02005;J Joules&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;50%/point) for laser therapy of the lumbar spine is recommended by the World Association for Laser Therapy,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> however these recommendations refer to non-acupuncture LLLT. A recent German LA trial of a much higher energy &#x02018;laser needle&#x02019; device failed to show a specific effect of laser treatment.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Future research also needs to consider LA treatment of other musculoskeletal problems.</p><p>This trial only partly clarifies decisions for therapists contemplating purchasing expensive laser pointer machines in the lower energy range to treat back pain. While there appear to be considerable improvements in pain and other measures following treatment using such devices, this trial suggests that the effect is not specifically due to laser at the low dosage commonly used in clinical practice. Scope however remains for further research to determine dosage windows and conditions that could respond to LA.</p><boxed-text position="float"><caption><title>Summary points</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A total of 144 patients with low back pain received either 0.2 or 0.8&#x02005;J/point infrared laser acupuncture or placebo control.</p></list-item><list-item><p>All outcomes improved up to 1&#x02005;year, with no differences between groups.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This low dose of laser has no biological effect, but higher doses should also be tested.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="acupmed-2013-010456-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1210" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Web appendix</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="acupmed-2013-010456-s2.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1215" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><caption><title>Web figure</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="acupmed-2013-010456-s3.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1220" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Correction notice:</bold> This article has been corrected since it was published Online First.
