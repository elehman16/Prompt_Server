KH176 is an orally bio-available small molecule under development for the treatment of mitochondrial(&#x02212;related) diseases. The compound is a member of a new class of drugs, acting as a potent intracellular redox-modulating agent essential for the control of oxidative and redox pathologies. The aim of this randomized, placebo controlled, double-blinded phase 1 study was to test safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of KH176 in healthy male volunteers. Putative effects on redox related biomarkers were explored.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">KH176 was well tolerated up to and including a single dose of 800&#x000a0;mg and multiple doses of 400&#x000a0;mg b.i.d. for 7&#x000a0;Days. However, when the QT interval was corrected for heart rate, administration of single doses of 800 and 2000&#x000a0;mg and at a multiple dose of 400&#x000a0;mg KH176 had marked effects. Post-hoc analysis of the ECGs showed clear changes in cardiac electrophysiology at single doses of 800 and 2000&#x000a0;mg and multiple doses of 400&#x000a0;mg b.i.d.. At lower doses, detailed ECG analysis showed no changes in electrophysiology compared to placebo. Exposure-response modelling of the cardiac intervals revealed an exposure range of KH176 without effects on cardiac conduction and provided a threshold of 1000&#x000a0;ng/mL above which changes in intervals could occur. After single- and multiple-dose administration, the pharmacokinetics of KH176 was more than dose proportional. KH176 accumulated to a small extent and food only slightly affected the pharmacokinetics of KH176, which was considered clinically irrelevant. Renal excretion of unchanged KH176 and its metabolite represents a minor pathway in the elimination of KH176. As expected in healthy volunteers no effects on redox biomarkers were observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par3">The study deemed that KH176 is well tolerated up to single doses of 800&#x000a0;mg and multiple doses of 400&#x000a0;mg b.i.d. and has a pharmacokinetic profile supportive for a twice daily dosing. Only at high doses, KH176 causes clinically relevant changes in cardiac electrophysiology, including prolonged QTc interval and changes in T wave morphology. A Phase 2 clinical trial (100&#x000a0;mg b.i.d., orally) has been conducted recently of which the final results are expected Q1 2018.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">

This genetic heterogeneity is one of the numerous factors explaining the phenotypic variability seen in mitochondrial diseases, including many mono-, and multisystem phenotypes in childhood and adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although the rate of deterioration is variable, the disease course is often progressive and the prognosis of some of the childhood diseases is even very poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].

Quantification of KH176 and its metabolite KH176m were performed using a validated LC-MS/MS method with good (max 15&#x02013;20% CV) selectivity, precision and accuracy, little carry over effect, good stability of both the solutions and the samples.</p><p id="Par39">For mean value calculations, all values below the limit of quantification (LOQ) were set to zero.

Quantification of oxidized and reduced glutathione was performed at York Bioanalytical solutions using a previously described validated method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

Correction of the QT interval is indicated to allow comparison between QT values over different heart rates, since the QT interval shortens with higher heart rates. In the post-hoc analysis, we have used the Fridericia formula (QTcF&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;QT/RR<sup>1/3</sup>), which is more reliable compared to the QTcB outside the range of 60&#x02013;100&#x000a0;bpm. The goal of this post-hoc optimization study was to repeat the machine-read ECG assessment with a highly automated computer-assisted approach where in addition to the re-evaluation of standard intervals (PR, QRS and QT intervals), a set of parameters describing repolarization morphology were considered. The morphology indices were the TpTe interval (interval from the T wave apex to the end of the T wave), the TpTe/QT index (the ratio between the TpTe interval and the QT interval), Tamp (the amplitude in microvolt units of the T wave) and TSym (an index of repolarization morphology based on the symmetry of the T wave).</p><p id="Par42">ECGs were digitally recorded using a Schiller AT104 ECG machine (500&#x000a0;Hz, 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;V). Cardiac interval measurements were performed on the Global Superimposed Median Beat (GSMB), a methodology that allows measurements that consider each of the 12 individual median beats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This measurement methodology ensures that the PR, QRS, and QT interval are measured from the earliest onset in any lead to the latest deflection in any lead. Cardiologist overview of the computer-based measurements is based on the superimposed (overlapped) display of the individual median beats, to assure measurements are performed at the earliest onset of any viable lead to the latest offset of any viable lead.</p><p id="Par43">The RR interval used for heart-rate correction of the QT interval (QTcB) was based on all the beats in the ten second recording.</p><p id="Par44">Other cardiac parameters were computed from the 12-lead vector magnitude VM (e.g. the square root of the sum of squares at each digital sample) computed from the individual median beats. On the VM lead, the apex of the T wave is placed and used to compute the TpTe interval (using the end of the T wave from the GSMB) and the T wave amplitude (height in microvolt of the VM T peak from the isoelectric line).

T wave symmetry index was computed using a proprietary approach based on Gaussian Mesa function modeling (GMF) of the repolarization waves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Briefly, the ascending and descending phases of the VM T wave are modeled by two independent half-Gaussian curves (see Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). The standard deviations of these functions (&#x003c3;1 and &#x003c3;2) and indicators of the ascending/descending speed and their ratio is an index of symmetry (TSym&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x003c3;1/&#x003c3;2; TSym&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1 for a perfectly symmetric T wave, TSym &#x0003c;1 for slow-ascending/fast-descending T waves, <italic>T</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;1 for fast-ascending/slow-decending T waves).</p><p id="Par45">For the pre-dose (baseline) ECGs, all parameters per time point were calculated as the averages of the triplicate ECGs. Computation of QTcB and QTcF was performed using the RR interval averaged from the total ECG acquisition duration (10&#x000a0;s) and in the case of the triplicate ECGs is based on the average QT and average HR of the replicate ECGs.</p><p id="Par46">The over-reading cardiologist provided a clinical interpretation for each ECG at each time point. Each ECG was classified as Normal, Abnormal Clinically Insignificant (ACI), or Abnormal Clinically Significant (ACS), based on absolute changes in QTc interval (&#x0003e; 450&#x000a0;ms), changes from baseline (&#x0003e;60&#x000a0;ms) and the presence of secondary arrhythmias.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single- and multiple-ascending doses of KH176 in healthy male subjects.</p><p id="Par70">KH176 was well tolerated in doses up to 800&#x000a0;mg SD and 400&#x000a0;mg b.i.d.. Headache was the most frequently reported AE in both the KH176 - and the placebo treated groups. Although there was no clear dose-response relationship for any of the adverse effects after single and multiple dose administration, unforeseen markedly more severe adverse events were reported after a single dose of 2000&#x000a0;mg. At this dose, which is a factor 10 above the anticipated daily human efficacious dose of 200&#x000a0;mg/day, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and psychiatric disturbances were reported, along with a prolonged corrected QT time.</p><p id="Par71">The shape of the plasma concentration-time profiles of KH176 and its metabolite KH176m were similar after single- and multiple-dose administration. The pharmacokinetics of KH176 showed several aspects. In particular, the pharmacodynamics of KH176 were characterized by a i) median t<sub>max</sub> between 0.75 and 2.0&#x000a0;h, ii) terminal t<sub>1/2</sub> of about 10&#x000a0;h, iii) biphasic elimination, and a iv) more than dose proportional increases in both C<sub>max</sub> and AUC.</p><p id="Par72">In vitro, KH176 is metabolized by CYP3A4 and excreted by the PgP efflux pump. We did not observe signs for auto-induction in this study such as a decline in pre-dose concentrations. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, the more than proportional increase with dose could be caused by saturation of the PgP efflux pump for which KH176 is a substrate, as evidenced by the fact that half-life and clearance doesn&#x02019;t change with dose, but rather the availability seems to change with dose. Up to 25.1% of an administered dose is excreted via urine after multiple dosing. In steady state conditions at 100&#x000a0;mg BID dosing the maximum concentration reached ranges within 303&#x02013;458&#x000a0;ng/mL for KH176 and 89.4&#x02013;204&#x000a0;ng/mL for KH167m (hence the maximum concentrations of these active moieties ranged within 392.4&#x02013;662&#x000a0;ng/mL).</p><p id="Par73">Based on the results of the multiple-dose administration, steady state was reached at the first time point of measurement of trough concentrations (Day 4). Based on the estimated t<sub>1/2</sub>, it is expected that steady state will be reached after 2 to 3&#x000a0;Days of dosing. KH176 was well tolerated in the presence of food, and the tolerability and safety profile in the presence and absence of food was similar. Although the point estimates (as well as the sample covariance) for both C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-inf</sub> did not completely remain within the usually accepted range of 0.8 to 1.25 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), no special measures are warranted regarding the intake of KH176.</p><p id="Par74">KH176 clearly modifies cardiac repolarisation in a dose-dependent manner. QTcF prolongation was present after single-dose administration of 800 and 2000&#x000a0;mg and after multiple doses of 400&#x000a0;mg of KH176 b.i.d.. Post-hoc studies showed that this QTcF prolongation was associated with changes in morphology and other cardiac intervals. Detailed analysis of the ECGs during the single-dose administration of 200, 100, 30 and 10&#x000a0;mg and multiple oral doses of 100 and 200&#x000a0;mg b.i.d. showed no cardiac electrophysiological abnormalities. Moreover, the changes in the QTcF interval in the 800&#x000a0;mg KH176 single dose and the 400&#x000a0;mg b.i.d KH176 dose did not reach the threshold for clinical relevance. The KH176 related changes in cardiac repolarisation include a reduction of T wave amplitude, a prolongation of the TpTe interval and a reduction of the T wave symmetry index. The reduction in T wave amplitude is largely explained by changes in heart rate and also seen in the placebo group. The prolongation of the TpTe interval and the reduction on the symmetry index indicate a prolongation of the descending phase of the T wave. With pure hERG blockade, there is a direct relationship between increasing plasma drug concentrations and the risk for torsades. Importantly, although the specific T wave morphology changes observed in this study have been associated with the hERG potassium channel blockade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], the IC<sub>50</sub> of hERG blocking for KH176 was 3 times higher than the C<sub>max</sub> for the highest dose.</p><p id="Par75">The clinical relevance of these changes in cardiac electrophysiology are not clear yet. Notably, there were 2 subjects with a potentially clinically relevant change (&#x0003e;60&#x000a0;ms) at the peak concentration after administration of 2000&#x000a0;mg but no signs of arrhythmias or severe morphologic changes (such as T wave bumps, notches, etc) were observed. One should be cautious when translating these healthy volunteer results to a patient population. Since the sensitivity to torsades de pointes also depends on many other factors including cardiovascular disease, alcoholic liver disease, obesity, hypertension, and/or electrolyte disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], high concentrations (e.g. more than a total daily dose of 1000&#x000a0;mg) of KH176 preferably should not be given to patients with any of these risk factors. Moreover, until dose adjustments for patients with concomitant medication (also metabolized by CYP3A4) are determined, high concentrations (e.g. more than a total daily dose of 1000&#x000a0;mg) of KH176 should preferably not be given to these patients either since unpredictable pharmacokinetics will possibly lead to plasma concentrations of KH176 above the currently defined safety threshold.</p><p id="Par76">Since the mechanism of KH176 is based on correction of an abnormal redox balance, as expected, we did not observe any pharmacodynamic changes in the healthy male volunteers.</p><p id="Par77">Comparing human exposure to mouse exposure in the in vivo mouse studies and benchmarking human exposure to in vitro activity of KH176 and metabolites indicates that 100&#x000a0;mg b.i.d. dosing results in a putatively efficacious exposure to be tested in the following Proof of Concept study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par78">We conclude that administration of single doses up to and including 800&#x000a0;mg or multiple doses up to 400&#x000a0;mg b.i.d. for 7&#x000a0;days of KH176, a new small redox-modulating molecule developed to treat mitochondrial(&#x02212;related) diseases and conditions, is safe and well tolerated in healthy male volunteers. Although doses above the anticipated human efficacious dose could lead to prolongation of the QTc interval with T-wave abnormalities, these changes did not reach the threshold for clinical relevance in these men. We have recently performed a phase 2 study in m.3243A&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;G carriers, administering the anticipated efficacious dose which did not lead to changes in cardiac electrophysiology in healthy men (100&#x000a0;mg KH176 b.i.d). Based on the study reported here, patients with cardiac abnormalities were excluded for safety reasons.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec23"><p>
