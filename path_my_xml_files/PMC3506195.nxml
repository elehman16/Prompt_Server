Nevertheless, it remains an important clinical issue in developed countries. In China, gastric cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death, and the world-adjusted mortality rate from gastric cancer is the highest in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>The prognosis of patients with locally advanced gastric cancer is generally dismal; 5-year OS rates are generally 25&#x000a0;% or less even when multimodal treatment strategies involving surgery, perioperative chemotherapy, and radiation are used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Most studies to date indicated that adjuvant chemotherapy had little impact on the OS rate. There is currently no standard regimen for postoperative treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, although convincing data are lacking, postoperative chemotherapy based on 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) has been widely used in China.</p><p>The immunosuppressed status of patients with cancer has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Immunosuppression may be more serious after surgery for the treatment for malignant diseases, including gastric cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. After adjuvant chemotherapy, the host&#x02019;s immune functions would be expected to be further damaged because most chemotherapeutic agents are immunosuppressive. There has been a considerable interest in the hypothesis that impaired immunity is common in cancer patients and that tumor may recur unless therapy to reverse immunosuppression is administered together with anticancer treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Many reports indicate that adjuvant immunotherapy with immune response cells or biological response modifiers may augment the host immune system, leading to improved survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Several studies published in recent years on gastric cancer suggested a significant improvement in patients receiving immunotherapy with nonspecific immunopotentiators such as polysaccharide K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], bacille Calmette&#x02013;Gu&#x000e9;rin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and OK-432 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Adjuvant immunotherapy is expected to be synergistic with surgical resection in the treatment for malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Thus, adjuvant immunotherapy may represent an effective modality to improve the survival rate of patients with gastric cancer.</p><p>Treatment with cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells is one of the promising cellular immunotherapies. It has been demonstrated that CIK cells proliferate abundantly in vitro and can kill tumor cells directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Furthermore, CIK cells can regulate and increase host cellular immune function in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Therefore, it is biologically plausible to investigate the use of CIK cells for immunotherapy against residual tumor cells. The combination of CIK cells and chemotherapy has been used in clinical practice and has shown potential benefits in patients with recurrent tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>We previously reported that immunotherapy with CIK cells improved the response rate and increased the 2-year survival rate of patients suffering from advanced gastric cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In the study reported here, we compared the long-term effect of adjuvant immunotherapy with CIK cells and chemotherapy only on the survival of patients with locally advanced gastric cancer following gastrectomy, and we investigated the changes in hosts&#x02019; cellular immune functions after CIK-cell therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study patients</title><p>All patients who had undergone gastrectomy and were histologically confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma were consecutively recruited through the Department of Tumor Biological Treatment Clinic at The Third Affiliated Hospital, University of Soochow between May 2002 and June 2005, as part of a clinical trial study on gastric adenocarcinoma. These patients were diagnosed and histologically confirmed with stage IIIA, IIIB, or IV (M0) according to the International Union Against Cancer (UICC 2002) TNM system; had to have received 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy based on 5-FU; and had to have had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less before adjuvant chemotherapy. The exclusion criteria for eligibility were receipt of adjuvant radiotherapy or other immunotherapy, concurrent active malignancy, and recurrence identified within 6&#x000a0;months after operation.

To our knowledge, no studies of adjuvant adoptive immunotherapy with immune response cells for gastric cancer have previously been reported. Studies have shown that immune response cells such as lymphokine-activated killer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody-induced killer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and CIK cells may kill tumor cells directly with high proliferative activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. These cells are non-major histocompatibility complex-restricted in target cell recognition and killing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Interestingly, CIK cells have also been shown to be effective against multidrug-resistant and FasL-positive malignant cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Moreover, CIK cells can regulate and increase host cellular immune function in vivo by secretion of cytokines, such as interferon-gamma, and a number of chemokines, including RANTES, MIP-1&#x003b1;, and MIP-1&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Because of their inherently high antitumor activity, CIK cells represent one of the promising cellular immunotherapies. Studies have shown that CIK cells from tumor patients (autologous CIK cells) have a high proliferation rate and cytotoxic activity in vitro and have shown the efficacy and safety of transfusing such cells to patients with advanced cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>In a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], we have reported the number of CIK-cell therapy to cancer-related death in gastric cancer, showing significant differences in the survival for 156 gastric cancer patients. In the current study, we evaluated the effect of adjuvant immunotherapy with CIK cells after chemotherapy on survival of patients with locally advanced gastric cancer. In order to better balance between the two groups, we set the baseline at the end of six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, both the patients with early stage (stage I/II) and those without completion of six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy or recurrence within 6&#x000a0;months after surgery were excluded. We found an improvement of 9&#x000a0;% in 5-year OS rate (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.071) and an improvement of 17.9&#x000a0;% in 5-year DFS rate (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.044) in the patients receiving adjuvant immunotherapy. Moreover, the stratified analysis by Lauren&#x02019;s histological type revealed that patients with intestinal-type tumors, but not those with diffuse or mixed-type tumors, responded to immunotherapy. For the patients with intestinal-type tumors, not only OS but also DFS was significantly longer in the immunotherapy group than in the control group. The interpretation of these findings should be treated with caution as it is an exploratory analysis within a subgroup.</p><p>Interestingly, response of patients with intestinal-type tumors to immunotherapy was observed in another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In that study, a nonspecific immunopotentiator, bacille Calmette&#x02013;Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG), was added to chemotherapy. Treatment with BCG was started within 2&#x000a0;weeks after the beginning of chemotherapy and continued for 2&#x000a0;years or until death. The study indicated that adjuvant immunotherapy (BCG&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;FAM) might prolong the survival of gastric cancer patients after gastrectomy, in particular, in patients with pT2/T3 tumors and intestinal-type primary tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In agreement with what has been suggested by previous data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], our study indicated that Lauren&#x02019;s histological type is an important prognostic factor, while diffuse and mixed-type tumors are associated with an invasive growth pattern and short survival time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. It is well known that neither nonspecific immunopotentiators nor immune response cells can improve the host&#x02019;s immune system function immediately after a short treatment procedure. This may be an important reason why patients with diffuse and mixed-type tumors do not benefit from immunotherapy&#x02014;disease advances rapidly or patients die before immunotherapy can have an important effect.</p><p>In patients with advanced stages of cancer, the normal immune response is frequently observed to be altered or impaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Typically, immune function is evaluated by using parameters reflecting either functional or numerical changes of T lymphocytes. The measurement of T-lymphocyte subsets has been reported to be a useful clinical indicator of immunosuppression in a number of disease states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In this study, we found that the percentage of CD3<sup>+</sup> cells and the ratio of CD4<sup>+</sup> to CD8<sup>+</sup> cells were lower than the normal reference values. Similar results have been reported previously by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. We also found that the percentages of CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup> cells, and the ratio of CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> were significantly higher 1&#x000a0;week after the first cycle of CIK-cell therapy but had declined markedly at 2&#x000a0;months. However, 2&#x000a0;months after 3 cycles of immunotherapy, these values maintained a higher level than the baselines. These results indicate that CIK-cell therapy is helpful to improve the T-lymphocyte subset distribution, but the improvement resulting from a single cycle of therapy is short-lived. Therefore, to gain long-term therapeutic efficacy, multiple cycles of therapy should be administered.</p><p>At present, convincing data from large-scale clinical studies of adjuvant chemotherapy for gastric cancer are lacking. There is no standard regimen for adjuvant chemotherapy, although chemotherapy has been found to be active in the treatment for unresectable or metastatic gastric cancer in China. As the main purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of sustained CIK-cell therapy after adjuvant chemotherapy, we set up a baseline at the end of 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. This could be a limitation of this study without a standard regimen of adjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, a selection bias was another limitation of this study because this was a hospital-based study, and a limited number of patients in each group may not represent the patient population from which the patients arose. Therefore, larger and well-designed studies are needed to confirm our findings. As described previously by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], we also observed that CIK-cell therapy was well tolerated. CIK-cell transfusion was associated with no severe side effects, and the slight side effects that were noted, such as chills, fever, headache, and nausea and vomiting, were all eliminated by moderate treatment.</p><p>In conclusion, these results indicate that CIK-cell therapy is helpful to improve the host&#x02019;s immune function after chemotherapy, but multiple cycles are necessary for long-term therapeutic efficacy. Adjuvant immunotherapy with CIK cells can prolong DFS in patients with locally advanced gastric cancer who have undergone gastrectomy and may have a noticeable impact on OS in patients with intestinal-type tumors in particular.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully thank Stephanie Deming for article editing.
