These can range from slowing/eliminating the destructive process, maintaining an area for a defect repair and/or regeneration.</p><p>The management of periodontitis has progressed from simple debridement to the use of bone grafts, guided tissue regeneration, growth factors and tissue engineering. Recent advances in the bone graft have mainly considered the properties of osteogenesis, osteoconduction and osteoinduction and have focused on elimination of disease transmission, mitogenic and chemotactic effects of bioactive agents on periodontal ligament and alveolar bone cells in order to create a conducive environment for bone regeneration. Space creation and barrier placement have been documented to be two main aspects of regeneration.</p><p>Calcium sulfate (CS) and calcium phosphate compounds are attractive alternatives to autografts because of their biocompatibility, handling characteristics, porosity, and different rates of dissolution, and chemical and physical resemblance to bone mineral, ability to induce release of growth factors and potentially unlimited supply at a modest cost in addition to inhibition of epithelial migration.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Although CS is osteoconductive and not osteoinductive in itself, whereas in the presence of bone and/or periosteum it appears to become osteogenic.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] When sufficient organic matrix and functioning osteoblasts are present, these ions can be effectively utilized in bone formation. CS also seems to facilitate the migration of gingival fibroblasts and cell attachment and spreading and the angiogenic and anti-inflammatory potential of CS.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] A possible reason for the anti-inflammatory properties of CS is that it dissolves rapidly and is washed away before infection can occur.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] CS degrades quickly over a period of 4&#x02013;6 weeks and hence has a limited success as a bone graft for large defects (like molar extraction sites or sinus augmentation site). To address this problem, controlled release calcium sulfate (dentogen) and later on Nanocrystalline version of CS was developed.</p><p>Recent developments in nanomaterials and nanotechnology have provided a promising insight into the commercial applications of nanomaterials in the management of periodontal diseases. There has been significant progress made in recent years with the development and introduction of various metallic and polymeric materials structured in nano-scales. Nano-materials are of significant interest from a fundamental point of view because the properties of a material change when the size of the particles that makeup the material become nanoscopic.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] To exhibit characteristic properties such as larger surface area, well-defined structure, high reactivity and easy dispersibility; CS has reached another level, that is, at the nanolevel.</p><p>The present study was undertaken to evaluate the comparative potential of nano-crystalline CS, BoneGen and Dentogen both clinically and radiographically.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The study protocol was evaluated by the board of studies and approved by Ethical Committee of Pt.

All patients underwent a presurgical initial treatment consisting of oral hygiene instructions, scaling, root planing and occlusal therapy as needed. After 4 weeks, the revaluation was done to confirm that patients maintain an acceptable level of plaque control. During this presurgical phase, study models were constructed, and customized occlusal stent with a groove in occluso-apical direction was fabricated for each patient to serve as a fixed reference point (FRP) for measurements. A single masked examiner performed all measurements with a manual calibrated UNC-15 periodontal probe [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Gingival crevicular fluid samples were also collected from sites of attachment loss to assess interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 &#x003b2;) levels in all three groups.

It resorbs at a rate of approximately 1 mm/week.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Other grafting materials may leave unresorbed encapsulated particles even at 12 month recall interval. Clinical significance of such a fate may be irrelevant. Probing depth reduction, CAL gain with a consequent resolution of inflammation and arrest of disease progression may be more important and desired outcome.</p><p>Even if there is a tendency for better results in the CS treated defects in terms of pocket depth reduction, these may not translate into greater CAL gains indicating a greater tendency toward gingival recession at the experimental defect sites.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Peltier and Jones 1978 demonstrated that osteoconduction requires the bone-graft substitute to have a resorption rate similar to the rate of new-bone formation. If the rate of resorption is faster than the rate of bone growth, the new bone will not have a scaffold on which to travel. Conversely, if the graft material resorbs too slowly it may stay in the osseous defect and block the ingrowth of new bone.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Defect fill and defect resolution are the main outcomes that are usually reported by regenerative studies by Grimard <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and Stavropoulos and Karring[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] While defect fill takes into account only the changes at the base of the defect; defect resolution takes into account the changes in alveolar crest that may occur with regenerative therapy in addition to fill of the defect at the base. Thus, it may be interpreted that defect resolution is a better parameter.</p><p>A study by Park <italic>et al</italic>. 2011 observed by surface microhardness testing that nCS was stronger than conventional CS, which provides an additional advantage to the scaffolding properties of the material.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Furthermore, the surface area of nCS was about 10 times greater than that of a conventional micron-sized form which allows for greater adsorption of growth factors, higher surface area for attachment of osseous cells and more efficient osteoconductivity. CS degradation and subsequent bone regeneration occur rapidly during a period of weeks or months.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Nanocrystalline structure of CS granules allows the material to have a controlled degradation over 10&#x02013;12 weeks (compared to traditional CS, which degrades in 4&#x02013;6 weeks).[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The combination between the controlled degradation of nCS and excellent properties of CS adequately supports graft resorption and bone remodeling whereas BoneGen TR has resorption rate of 16 weeks.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] BoneGen is a composite of CS and PLLA. PLLA is a polymer with a long history of safe use in implantable medical devices. It is biocompatible, nontoxic and biodegradable. This nano-composite bone graft material, with a CS to PLLA ratio of 96:4 provides benefits of CS with a slower degradation profile to allow for complete bone filling in large defects. It takes about approximately 16 weeks for complete degradation.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Poly-L-lactic acid degrades at a rate sufficiently slow to be useful and undergoes hydrolytic de-esterification to form metabolites normally found in the body. Nevertheless, the lactic-acid-rich degradation products have the potential to significantly lower the local pH in a closed space surrounded by bone. It was hypothesized that this acidity may tend to cause abnormal bone resorption and/or demineralization.</p><p>There was statistically no significant inter-group difference in the mean amount of bone fill at follow up intervals.</p><p>No significant intra-group change in defect fill was observed between 6 and 12 months, that is, indicating that the defect had already been filled to an optimum level by 6 months. Mean change during 6&#x02013;12 months was maximum in Group III whereas in Group I and II a negative change in % defect fill was observed [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].</p><p>There were two cases in Group I where unexpected results were obtained. In one case, defect fill at 6 months was 44.4% and at 6 months it was found 11.1% and in other case, defect fill was 50% at 6 months and 37.5% at 12 months due to unexplained reasons.</p><p>Intragroup comparisons showed that there was a statistically significant improvement in the amount of defect resolution of all the groups from baseline to 6 months and 12 months.</p><p>The significant changes in defect resolution can be attributed to increase in the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions as CS dissolves. The released Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions react with the PO<sub>4</sub> ions in the body, re-precipitating as calcium phosphate, which stimulates osteoblastic activity.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] CS resorption causes pH to drop thereby demineralizing the surface of nearby bone exposing and/or releasing bone morphogenetic proteins, transforming growth factor-beta and other growth factors contained in the bone matrix[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].</p><p>Engebretson <italic>et al</italic>. 2002 in their study observed that IL-1 &#x003b2; levels in GCF were not strictly a function of probing pocket depth and CAL and high GCF IL-1 &#x003b2; expression was in part a host trait.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>In our study, no statistically significant intergroup difference was found in all three groups, thus showing results in accordance with their outcomes [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Both Nanogen and BoneGen can be considered valuable options in the treatment of infrabony periodontal defects although the cost of these materials is not commensurate with the clinical outcome. The enhanced gain in CAL with Nanogen between 6 months and 12 months could be attributed to its controlled degradation over 10&#x02013;12 weeks and release of fibroblast growth factor, which facilitates migration of gingival fibroblasts and cell attachment and spreading and also increased surface area due to its nano-size as compared to conventional micron-sized CS. Although our study did not show any advantage of NCS or CRP, radiographic and histological investigations have shown that the extraction socket grafted with NCS had fully regenerated with vital bone by 12 months.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] However, to confirm the success of a Nanogen large study populations and longer evaluation time periods are required.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
