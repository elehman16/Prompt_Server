Later, the term &#x0201c;oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF)&#x0201d; was coined by S.G Joshi in 1953. The disease is predominantly seen in India among Asian countries, with a reported prevalence ranging up to 0.4% in Indian rural population. Based on a study conducted in 2002, more than 5 million people in India suffer from OSMF, 0.5% of Indian population.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The habit of betel quid chewing is widespread throughout India and Southeast Asia. Moreover, it is widely prevalent in teenagers and young adult.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Buccal mucosa, faucial pillar, and soft palate are predominantly affected. Underlying muscles and the muscles of mastication can also be involved. Currently, pentoxifylline, a tri-substituted methylxanthine derivative, is reported to have satisfactory result in the management of OSMF due to their immune modulation, alteration of fibroblast physiology, rheologic modification, and anti-inflammatory property.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Very few studies have been done so far regarding effectiveness of pentoxifylline in OSMF, that too mainly subjective evaluation such as mouth opening, blanching of oral mucosa, and burning sensation.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Objective evaluation of the treatment outcome in OSMF patient can be carried out using ultrasonography (USG), which provides real-time imaging of soft tissue.</p><p>The purpose of the study is to evaluate objectively the effectiveness of oral pentoxifylline for the treatment of OSMF using high-frequency USG in comparison to conventional intralesional steroid therapy with dexamethasone and hyaluronidase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee. The study population included a total of thirty patients, who reported to the Department of Oral Medicine and radiology, either of the sex who were diagnosed as OSMF based on habitual history and clinical findings. Informed consent was obtained from every patient, and they were subjected to routine blood investigation and habit cessation counseling in our institution before and during the study.</p><p>A clinical diagnosis of OSMF was made, and patients were numbered serially as they entered the study and patients were graded clinically according to Khanna and Andrade (1995) classification. Only Grade II and Grade III were included in the study. Thirty patients were included conveniently in the study in single-blind randomized manner to the following groups alternatively irrespective of age, sex, and stage of OSMF.</p><p>

</p><p>Clinical parameters included in the study to evaluate the effectiveness of the drugs were burning sensation and mouth opening. USG parameters included were submucosal thickness and echogenicity. The intensity of burning sensation was determined using a visual analog scale of 0&#x02013;10 with 10 mm division, where 0 was no burning sensation and 10 was worst possible burning sensation. The interincisal mouth opening was measured using a Vernier caliper from the mesioincisal angle of upper central incisor to the mesioincisal angle of lower central incisor and recorded in centimeters.</p><p>USG measurements of submucosal thickness and echogenicity were performed for 30 patients comprising 15 in each group. A pilot study was first done in ten healthy volunteers regarding accuracy and reproducibility of USG measurements. After the approval from the Ethical Committee, the study was conducted in OSMF patients with repeated measurements and averaging the three consecutive measurements, which was finally taken for statistical analysis.</p><p>Scanning was performed using multifrequency linear transducer with a frequency ranging from 3 to 12 MHz (Siemens) which was connected to the scanner; real-time imaging of buccal mucosae was performed. Buccal mucosa was selected for USG evaluation as it is commonly involved next to faucial pillar and it is easily approachable for proper evaluation. Patients were prior instructed to indicate the mucosa by placing the forefinger inside the mouth against the mucosa to delineate the lining mucosa and empty space of the oral cavity as stated by Wilson <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Patients were also told not to apply finger pressure against the mucosa but just a finger touch movement of the mucosa. The real-time imaging of the right and left buccal mucosa was carried out, and the measurements were taken. Mucosal lining was seen as a hyperechoic linear line, submucosa as a band of hypoechoic zone supported by a muscle planes in controls. This band of hypoechogenicity in between hyperechoic mucosa and muscle layer was measured as submucosa. All measurements were taken in centimeters.</p><p>With increased severity of OSMF, submucosa is thought to become more hyperechoic as compared to hypoechoic in normal patients. Hyperechogenicity is marked as 1 and hypoechogenicity is marked as 2. Since differences in reliability of ultrasonic assessments of mucosal thickness in different parts of oral cavity may depend on the difficulties of repeatedly measuring at the same location, on varying thickness of tissue. These problems might be resolved by averaging multiple measurements. After preoperative USG evaluation, patients in Group A were administered oral pentoxifylline 400 mg thrice daily after meals for 3 months, and patients in Group B were administered intralesional injection of 0.5 ml of local anesthesia with 2 ml of dexamethasone and 1500 I.U of hyaluronidase biweekly for 6 weeks. After the course of the treatment scheduled, all the patients of both the groups were subjected to postoperative USG evaluation of submucosal thickness and echogenicity similar to preoperative evaluation and the values are recorded. Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> show pre- and post-operative evaluation of submucosa using USG. All the values were statistically analyzed and the results were drawn. Both groups were followed for 6 months; no significant recurrence or any compliance was noticed. However, further extended follow-up with increased sample is required for long-term outcome of the drug.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Preoperative (a) and postoperative (b) ultrasonographic evaluation of buccal mucosa of Case 1 showed submucosal thickness reduced from 0.9 to 0.6 mm and echogenicity also changes from hyper to hypo</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="CCD-8-200-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Preoperative (a) and postoperative (b) ultrasonographic evaluation of buccal mucosa of Case 2 showed submucosal thickness reduced from 0.8 to 0.6 mm and echogenicity also changes from hyper to hypo</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="CCD-8-200-g002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Preoperative (a) and postoperative (b) ultrasonographic evaluation of buccal mucosa of Case 3 showed submucosal thickness reduced from 0.6 to 0.4 mm and echogenicity also changes from hyper to hypo</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="CCD-8-200-g003"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>A total of thirty patients with age ranging from 23 to 54 years, with the mean age being 35.4 years in Group A and 32.8 years in Group B, were included in the study.

Various treatment modalities have been elucidated to alleviate the symptoms associated with OSMF.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Currently, oral pentoxifylline has been proved to have beneficial result in treating OSMF because of its anti-inflammatory, fibrinolytic, immunomodulatory, and rheologic modifying property. Pentoxifylline improves red blood cell membrane deformability by increasing the amount of membrane adenosine triphosphate. It also alters red blood cell membrane protein phosphorylation patterns, increases protein kinase activity, and decreases Ca <sup>2+</sup>-dependent K <sup>+</sup> efflux. The results of experimental studies have shown that fibroblasts cultured in the presence of pentoxifylline produced twice as much collagenase activity and decreased amounts of collagen, glycosaminoglycans, and fibronectin. Interleukin-1-induced fibroblast proliferation is also inhibited by pentoxifylline. All these actions of pentoxifylline have made to think in terms of management for oral submucous fibrosis.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The present study was done to evaluate the effectiveness of oral pentoxifylline in the management of OSMF; evaluation was done using USG as it provides both qualitative and quantitative assessment of oral mucosa.</p><p>Several categories of drugs have been used in the treatment of OSMF, but their effectiveness leaves much to be desired and no treatment regimen has afforded definitive cure.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] While oral administration limits the concentration of drugs in lesional tissue and increases the potential for side effects, the intralesional injections are associated with significant mechanical injury and noncompliance on the patient's part because of the accompanying discomfort and pain.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In this study, both pentoxifylline and dexamethasone groups showed a significant improvement in mouth opening and reduction in burning sensation. Pentoxifylline appears to be well tolerated. Only two patients experienced side effects, but neither had reason to discontinue the therapy. Most side effects caused by pentoxifylline involve the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. The most frequent gastrointestinal complaints include dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, and bloating, in case of central nervous system side effects include dizziness and headache, tremor, anxiety, and confusion in a small percentage of patients. Both central nervous system and gastrointestinal side effects are dose related and are therefore minimized by dose reduction. Hence, pentoxifylline can be a good alternative in the management of OSMF, for whom intralesional steroids or hyaluronidase are contraindicated, for those who cannot make frequent visit and to avoid pain due to injection. Moreover, most importantly, pentoxifylline is cost-effective and more compliant to the patient.</p><p>Furthermore, qualitative and quantitative assessment of pentoxifylline effectiveness in treating OSMF was assessed by USG, which showed marked changes in submucosal thickness and echogenicity in lieu with the clinical improvement.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Hence, USG can be considered as a valuable tool in assessing the severity, extension, disease progression, and treatment outcome objectively and efficiently. However, further descriptive study is required to substantiate the sensitivity of USG in OSMF evaluation in all respects.</p><p>However, the results of our study need to be confirmed in a larger population of OSMF patients with a longer period of follow-up. In addition, further study is required to assess the effectiveness of pentoxifylline on the basis of extent of efficacy in different age groups, at various stages of OSMF, and duration of habit associated with OSMF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Pentoxifylline can be used as promising alternative treatment modality to intralesional steroid for treatment of OSMF, where the later is contraindicated or not well tolerated by the patients.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"
