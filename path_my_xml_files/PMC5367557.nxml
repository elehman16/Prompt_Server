Previous studies suggest that psilocybin may decrease depression and anxiety in cancer patients. The effects of psilocybin were studied in 51 cancer patients with life-threatening diagnoses and symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. This randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial investigated the effects of a very low (placebo-like) dose (1 or 3 mg/70 kg) vs. a high dose (22 or 30 mg/70 kg) of psilocybin administered in counterbalanced sequence with 5 weeks between sessions and a 6-month follow-up. Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy effects. Participants, staff, and community observers rated participant moods, attitudes, and behaviors throughout the study. High-dose psilocybin produced large decreases in clinician- and self-rated measures of depressed mood and anxiety, along with increases in quality of life, life meaning, and optimism, and decreases in death anxiety. At 6-month follow-up, these changes were sustained, with about 80% of participants continuing to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and anxiety. Participants attributed improvements in attitudes about life/self, mood, relationships, and spirituality to the high-dose experience, with &#x0003e;80% endorsing moderately or greater increased well-being/life satisfaction. Community observer ratings showed corresponding changes. Mystical-type psilocybin experience on session day mediated the effect of psilocybin dose on therapeutic outcomes.</p><p>

Antidepressants and, less frequently, benzodiazepines are used to treat depressed mood and anxiety in cancer patients, although evidence suggesting efficacy is limited and conflicting, and benzodiazepines are generally only recommended for short-term use because of side effects and withdrawal (<xref rid="bibr17-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">Grassi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr40-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">Ostuzzi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr57-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">Walker et al., 2014</xref>). Although psychological approaches have shown only small to medium effects in treating emotional distress and quality of life, with low quality of reporting in many trials (<xref rid="bibr13-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">Faller et al., 2013</xref>), there are several promising interventions utilizing existential orientations to psychotherapy (<xref rid="bibr5-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">Breitbart et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr51-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">Spiegel, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The classic hallucinogens, which include psilocybin (psilocin) and (+)-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), are a structurally diverse group of compounds that are 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor agonists and produce a unique profile of changes in thoughts, perceptions, and emotions (<xref rid="bibr23-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">Halberstadt, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr39-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">Nichols, 2016</xref>). Several unblinded studies in the 1960s and 70s suggested that such compounds might be effective in treating psychological distress in cancer patients (<xref rid="bibr22-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">Grof et al., 1973</xref>; <xref rid="bibr32-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">Kast, 1967</xref>; <xref rid="bibr46-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">Richards et al., 1977</xref>); however, these studies did not include the comparison conditions that would be expected of modern psychopharmacology trials.</p><p>Subsequently, human research with these compounds was halted for almost three decades because of safety and other concerns raised in response to widespread non-medical use in the 1960s.

Both studies showed promising trends toward decreased psychological distress. Of most relevance to the present study with psilocybin, Grob and colleagues showed that a low-moderate dose of psilocybin (14 mg/70 kg) decreased a measure of trait anxiety at 1 and 3 months and depressed mood at 6-month follow-up. Also relevant, a recent open-label pilot study in 12 patients with treatment-resistant depression showed marked reductions in depressive symptoms 1 week and 3 months after administration of 10 and 25 mg of psilocybin in two sessions separated by 7 days (<xref rid="bibr6-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">Carhart-Harris et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The present study provides the most rigorous evaluation to date of the efficacy of a classic hallucinogen for treatment of depressed mood and anxiety in psychologically distressed cancer patients.

The duration of each participant&#x02019;s participation was approximately 9 months (mean 275 days).

Preparation meetings, the first meeting following each session, and the last meeting before the second session were always in person.

Briefly, preparation meetings before the first session, which included discussion of meaningful aspects of the participant&#x02019;s life, served to establish rapport and prepare the participant for the psilocybin sessions. During sessions, monitors were nondirective and supportive, and they encouraged participants to &#x0201c;trust, let go and be open&#x0201d; to the experience. Meetings after sessions generally focused on novel thoughts and feelings that arose during sessions. Session monitors were study staff originally trained by William Richards PhD, a clinical psychologist with extensive experience conducting studies with classic hallucinogens. Monitor education varied from college graduate to PhD. Formal clinical training varied from none to clinical psychologist. Monitors were selected as having significant human relations skills and self-described experience with altered states of consciousness induced by means such as meditation, yogic breathing, or relaxation techniques.</p></sec><sec id="section7-0269881116675513"><title>Psilocybin sessions</title><p>Drug sessions were conducted in an aesthetic living-room-like environment with two monitors present. Participants were instructed to consume a low-fat breakfast before coming to the research unit. A urine sample was taken to verify abstinence from common drugs of abuse (cocaine, benzodiazepines, and opioids including methadone). Participants who reported use of cannabis or dronabinol were instructed not to use for at least 24 h before sessions. Psilocybin doses were administered in identically appearing opaque, size 0 gelatin capsules, with lactose as the inactive capsule filler. For most of the time during the session, participants were encouraged to lie down on the couch, use an eye mask to block external visual distraction, and use headphones through which a music program was played. The same music program was played for all participants in both sessions. Participants were encouraged to focus their attention on their inner experiences throughout the session.

Although double-blind methods are usually used to protect against such effects, expectancy is likely to be significantly operative in a standard drug versus placebo design when the drug being evaluated produces highly discriminable effects and participants and staff know the specific drug conditions to be tested. For these reasons, in the present study a low dose of psilocybin was compared with a high dose of psilocybin, and participants and monitors were given instructions that obscured the actual dose conditions to be tested. Specifically, they were told that psilocybin would be administered in both sessions, the psilocybin doses administered in the two sessions might range anywhere from very low to high, the doses in the two sessions might or might not be the same, sensitivity to psilocybin dose varies widely across individuals, and that at least one dose would be moderate to high. Participants and monitors were further strongly encouraged to try to attain maximal therapeutic and personal benefit from each session.</p></sec><sec id="section9-0269881116675513"><title>Dose conditions</title><p>The study compared a high psilocybin dose (22 or 30 mg/70 kg) with a low dose (1 or 3 mg/70 kg) administered in identically appearing capsules. When this study was designed, we had little past experience with a range of psilocybin doses. We decreased the high dose from 30 to 22 mg/70 kg after two of the first three participants who received a high dose of 30 mg/70 kg were discontinued from the study (one from vomiting shortly after capsule administration and one for personal reasons). Related to this decision, preliminary data from a dose-effect study in healthy participants suggested that rates of psychologically challenging experiences were substantially greater at 30 than at 20 mg/70 kg (<xref rid="bibr20-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths et al., 2011</xref>). The low dose of psilocybin was decreased from 3 to 1 mg/70 kg after 12 participants because data from the same dose-effect study showed significant psilocybin effects at 5 mg/70 kg, which raised concern that 3 mg/70 kg might not serve as an inactive placebo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section10-0269881116675513"><title>Outcome measures</title><sec id="section11-0269881116675513"><title>Cardiovascular measures and monitor ratings assessed throughout the session</title><p>Ten minutes before and 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 min after capsule administration, blood pressure, heart rate, and monitor ratings were obtained as described previously (<xref rid="bibr19-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths et al., 2006</xref>).

An analogous pattern of results was shown for symptom remission to normal range (i.e. &#x02a7e;50% decrease relative to Baseline and a score of &#x02a7d;7 on GRID-HAMD-17 or HAM-A), with rates of symptom remission of 60% and 52% for depression and anxiety, respectively, 5 weeks after the high psilocybin dose in Session 1, and with rates of 71% and 63%, respectively, sustained at 6 months. Collapsing across the two dose sequence groups, the overall rate of clinical response at 6 months was 78% and 83% for depression and anxiety, respectively, and the overall rate of symptom remission at 6 months for all participants was 65% and 57%, respectively.</p><table-wrap id="table6-0269881116675513" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 6.</label><caption><p>Percentage of participants with clinically significant response rate and symptom remission rate as assessed with the clinician-rated measures of depression and anxiety<sup><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table-fn17-0269881116675513">+</xref><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table-fn18-0269881116675513">a</xref></sup>.</p></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0269881116675513-table6"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Measure</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</th><th align="left" colspan="6" rowspan="1">Assessment time-point<hr/></th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Post-session 1</th><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Post-session 2</th><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">6 months<sup><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table-fn19-0269881116675513">b</xref></sup></th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Clinical response</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Symptom remission</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Clinical response</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Symptom remission</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Clinical response</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Symptom remission</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2" colspan="1">GRID-HAMD-17&#x02003;(Depression)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Low-Dose-1st (High-Dose-2nd)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">32%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">16%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">75%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">58%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">77%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">59%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">High-Dose-1st (Low-Dose-2nd)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">92%<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table-fn18-0269881116675513">***</xref></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">60%<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table-fn18-0269881116675513">**</xref></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">84%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">68%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">79%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">71%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" colspan="1">HAM-A &#x02003;(Anxiety)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Low-Dose-1st (High-Dose-2nd)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">24%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">83%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">42%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">82%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">50%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">High-Dose-1st (Low-Dose-2nd)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">76%<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table-fn18-0269881116675513">***</xref></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">52%<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table-fn18-0269881116675513">**</xref></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">80%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">60%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">83%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">63%</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table-fn17-0269881116675513"><label>+</label><p>Data are percentage of participants fulfilling criteria at Post-session 1 (5 weeks after Session 1), Post-session 2 (5 weeks after Session 2), and 6 months.

Eleven of 17 therapeutically relevant measures fulfilled conservative criteria for demonstrating efficacy of the high dose of psilocybin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269881116675513">Table 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0269881116675513">Figure 3</xref>). The data show that psilocybin produced large and significant decreases in clinician-rated and self-rated measures of depression, anxiety or mood disturbance, and increases in measures of quality of life, life meaning, death acceptance, and optimism. These effects were sustained at 6 months. For the clinician-rated measures of depression and anxiety, respectively, the overall rate of clinical response at 6 months was 78% and 83% and the overall rate of symptom remission was 65% and 57%. Participants attributed to the high-dose experience positive changes in attitudes about life, self, mood, relationships and spirituality, with over 80% endorsing moderately or higher increased well-being or life satisfaction. These positive effects were reflected in significant corresponding changes in ratings by community observers (friends, family, work colleagues) of participant attitudes and behavior.</p><p>The results substantially extend the findings of a recent double-blind pilot study with a lower dose of psilocybin (14 mg/70 kg) in cancer patients that showed non-significant trends for benefits of psilocybin compared with placebo (niacin) on measures of depression and anxiety, with some significant decreases relative to baseline demonstrated at 1 to 6 months (<xref rid="bibr21-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">Grob et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The time-course, magnitude, and qualitative features of the high dose of psilocybin on session days were consistent with those observed in previous studies in healthy volunteers (<xref rid="bibr19-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bibr20-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr31-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The significant association of mystical-type experience (MEQ30) during Session 1 with most of the enduring changes in therapeutic outcome measures 5 weeks later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0269881116675513">Figure 5</xref>) is consistent with previous findings showing that such experiences on session days predict long-term positive changes in attitudes, mood, behavior, and spirituality (<xref rid="bibr15-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Romeu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr18-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bibr20-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). For most measures, this relationship continued to be significant when the intensity of overall psilocybin effect was controlled in a partial correlation analysis. This suggests that mystical-type experience per se has an important role apart from overall intensity of drug effect. Finally, a mediation analysis further suggested that mystical-type experience has a mediating role in positive therapeutic response.</p><p>The observed decreases in psychological distress and anxiety about death may relate to recent epidemiological findings that lifetime psilocybin use was associated with significantly reduced odds of past month psychological distress and suicidality (<xref rid="bibr25-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">Hendricks et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>An innovative feature of the study design was that participants and staff monitors were given instructions that obscured the actual psilocybin dose conditions to facilitate blinding and minimize expectancy effects, which are believed to be a significant determinant of classic hallucinogen effects (<xref rid="bibr19-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bibr37-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">Metzner et al., 1965</xref>). Evidence of some success of this blinding was provided in a post-study questionnaire completed by staff and by significant treatment effects observed after Session 1 in participants who received the very low dose of psilocybin. Although it was assumed that 1 mg/70 kg would be largely pharmacologically inactive, some pharmacological activity of this dose cannot be ruled out entirely. Thus, it might have been preferable to use an even lower dose of psilocybin (e.g. 0.01 mg/70 kg) to assure pharmacological inactivity while maintaining the benefit of the instruction that psilocybin would be administered on each session. Although the low-dose comparison condition and instructions to participants and staff facilitated blinding and minimized expectancy effects, it should be noted that these experimental design features may be difficult to implement in research settings that require complete disclosure of specific study conditions or arms.</p><p>Several additional experimental limitations should be noted. Participants were crossed over to the alternative dose condition after 5 weeks. Although this allowed assessment of acute and persisting effects of psilocybin in all study participants, it precluded double-blind assessment of efficacy of the high dose of psilocybin based on across group comparisons after 5 weeks. As in previous research, the study documented enduring increases in positive changes in attitudes and mood on both the participant-rated Persisting Effects Questionnaire and on the Community Observer Questionnaire (<xref rid="bibr19-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bibr20-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). However, neither of these measures has been independently validated. Likewise, although the finding of significant decreases in depression and anxiety symptoms on both participant-rated and clinician-rated measures is a strength, the inclusion of blinded clinician ratings would further strengthen the study. The relatively small sample (<italic>n</italic> = 51) that was highly educated and predominately White limits the generality of conclusions.</p><p>Finally, it is important to note that the overall approach of treating cancer-related psychological distress with psilocybin is limited by a variety of exclusion criteria (see online Supplementary material) and by the significant time and cost of professional support provided before, during, and after the psilocybin session. Patients may also be reluctant to participate in such an intervention because high doses of psilocybin have sometimes been associated with transient episodes of psychological distress or anxiety in patients (current study and studies in healthy volunteers, <xref rid="bibr19-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bibr20-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>The neuropsychopharmacological mechanisms of psilocybin therapeutic effects remain speculative (<xref rid="bibr8-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">Carhart-Harris et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bibr7-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr39-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">Nichols, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr56-0269881116675513" ref-type="bibr">Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010</xref>).
