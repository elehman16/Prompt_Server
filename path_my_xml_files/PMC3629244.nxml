The American Heart Association currently recommends high-dose aspirin (80 to 100 mg/kg/day) during the acute phase,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1)</xref> while moderate-dose aspirin (30 to 50 mg/kg/day) is used in Japan due to concern about hepatic toxicity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2)</xref> Gastritis, upper gastrointestinal bleeding,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3)</xref> sensorineural hearing loss,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4)</xref> and rarely Reye syndrome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5)</xref> are also concerns with high-dose aspirin in children with KD. The therapeutic steady state salicylate levels are rarely achieved during the acute phase of KD because of decreased absorption<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6)</xref> and increased renal clearance of aspirin.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7)</xref> Despite this, hypoalbuminemia in the acute phase of the illness promotes less protein binding and higher free drug levels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8)</xref> Meanwhile, the primary goal of treating children with KD is to prevent coronary artery lesions (CALs). Some reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9)</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10)</xref> have shown that the incidence of CALs is highly dependent on the dose of IVIG, but independent of aspirin dose. This suggests that only antiplatelet doses of aspirin may be adequate during the acute phase of the disease.</p><p>Thus, considering the risks of drug toxicity and the lack of evidence for prevention of CALs, the role of high-dose aspirin in the acute phase of KD needs to be reassessed. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of treatment without high-dose aspirin in the acute phase of KD and thereby determine whether high-dose aspirin is necessary for the acute therapy of KD in the IVIG era.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><p>A total of 51 children who met the diagnostic criteria for KD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1)</xref> between October 2010 and September 2011 were enrolled as the study group. Subjects comprised 30 (58.8%) male and 21 female, aged 2.5 months to 11.5 years. All patients were treated with IVIG (2 g/kg) as a single infusion over 10 to 12 hours without concomitant use of aspirin 2 to 20 days after the onset of the disease. After defervescence, low-dose aspirin (3 to 5 mg/kg) was given as a single daily dose. When the patients remained febrile after the first IVIG therapy, they were retreated with additional therapy without aspirin. As the control group, we included a total of 129 KD patients who were treated with IVIG (2 g/kg) plus high-dose aspirin (80 to 100 mg/kg/day) 2 to 9 days after the onset of the illness, and then low-dose aspirin after defervescence between November 2008 and September 2010. This control group of patients was reported previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11)</xref></p><p>We measured white blood cell (WBC), percentage of neutrophils in WBCs (% neutrophils), hematocrit, platelet counts, serum sodium, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), protein, albumin, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and C-reactive protein (CRP) before and 48 to 72 hours after IVIG treatment. Kobayashi score<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12)</xref> was utilized as a marker of the severity of the disease. We arbitrarily considered CRP &#x0003c;3 mg/dL as an acceptable criterion for resolution of inflammation. When CRP remained &#x0003e;3 mg/dL following treatment, it was measured again 2 days later. Coronary arteries were assessed by echocardiography performed at the time of diagnosis and discharge, and repeated at weeks 4 and 8 after treatment, and then as needed thereafter. CALs were diagnosed according to the criteria of the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13)</xref> Patients who presented with CAL before initial treatment were excluded from the study.</p><p>Basic patient characteristics and laboratory measures before IVIG therapy were compared between the study and control group. We compared the response to initial IVIG, duration of fever after completion of initial IVIG treatment, time to CRP &#x0003c;3 mg/dL after IVIG administration, and the incidence of CALs between the groups. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the hospital (ECT 12-07A-21).</p><sec><title>Definition</title><p>Duration of fever to IVIG initiation was defined as the time from the onset of the disease to the start of initial IVIG infusion. Duration of fever after IVIG completion was defined as the time from the end of IVIG infusion to defervescence (&#x0003c;37.5&#x02103;). IVIG-responsive patients were defined as patients who became afebrile within 48 to 72 hours after initial IVIG infusion. IVIG-resistant patients were defined as those who required additional therapy owing to persistent fever (&#x02265;38&#x02103;) at least 48 hours after the end of initial IVIG infusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analyses</title><p>Analyses were performed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 12.0 statistical analysis software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

In patients treated with only aspirin without IVIG, no difference was found in the incidence of CALs between patients with high-dose aspirin (100 mg/kg/day) and those with moderate-dose aspirin (30 mg/kg/day).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16)</xref> Two large meta analyses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9)</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10)</xref> have shown that there is also no difference in the incidence of CALs between patients treated with high- (80 to 120 mg/kg/day) vs. moderate- (30 to 50 mg/kg/day) dose aspirin with IVIG. Recently, Hsieh et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18)</xref> reported that treatment with only IVIG without high- or moderate-dose aspirin has no effect on clinical outcome or development of CALs. All these studies suggest that low- or moderate-dose aspirin has efficacy similar to that of high-dose aspirin in the acute phase of KD, and furthermore that there is no benefit to high-dose aspirin in the acute phase of the illness.</p><p>In this study, the overall resistance to initial IVIG was 15.7% in the study group, not statistically different from 17.1% in the control group. This incidence is compatible with those in the previous studies, in which approximately 10% to 20% of patients have persistent or recrudescent fever after initial IVIG plus aspirin therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19)</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20)</xref> This result suggests that treatment without high-dose aspirin in the acute phase may not increase unresponsiveness to IVIG therapy.</p><p>With respect to post-IVIG duration of fever according to aspirin dose, Saulsbury<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21)</xref> demonstrated that there was no difference between patients treated with IVIG and either high- or low-dose aspirin. In our study, 83.7% of the IVIG-responsive patients became afebrile within 24 hours after IVIG therapy without use of aspirin. However, mean duration of fever after treatment was longer in the study group compared with the control group. This result is consistent with the findings of Akagi et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16)</xref> who showed that patients receiving high-dose aspirin had a shorter duration of fever.</p><p>We arbitrarily defined CRP &#x0003c;3 mg/dL as an acceptable level for resolution of inflammation by IVIG therapy, which was derived from the criterion of the American Heart Association for the evaluation of suspected incomplete KD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22)</xref> We found no difference between patients treated with versus without aspirin in the proportion of patients who maintained a high CRP at 48 to 72 hours after treatment and also in mean time to CRP &#x0003c;3 mg/dL. These findings suggest that treatment without aspirin may not affect the resolution of inflammation achieved by IVIG infusion.</p><p>The primary goal of treating KD patients is to prevent CALs. With regard to the incidence of CALs, we found that treatment without aspirin may not increase the development of CALs, and this finding is in an agreement with the study of Hsieh et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18)</xref> Therefore, we need to reassess the efficacy of high-dose aspirin in the acute treatment of KD. It seems unwise to expose children to high-dose aspirin therapy when the available data show no appreciable benefit in preventing CALs.</p><p>The limitation to this study is the small number of patients, which may weaken statistical analytic power. In addition, the study on control group was performed at different times. As CRPs were not measured daily, error may exist in the time to decrease in CRP. Finally, the use of Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare criteria may underestimate the true incidence of CALs in KD patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23)</xref></p><p>In conclusion, the treatment without high-dose aspirin in the acute phase of KD has no influence on the response to IVIG, decline in inflammation, or the development of CALs. Therefore, high-dose aspirin may provide little benefit to the treatment of acute KD. Future prospective study with a larger number of patients, ideally a randomized trial, is needed to establish the true efficacy of high-dose aspirin for the acute therapy of KD in the IVIG era.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors have no financial conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation
