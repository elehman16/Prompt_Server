Short-term studies (3&#x02013;12 weeks) in humans have suggested that high-dose benfotiamine (up to 600 mg/day) can improve symptomatic scores in diabetic polyneuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). To assess the efficacy of long-term supplementation, we conducted a 24-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the effects of 300 mg/day benfotiamine supplementation on peripheral nerve function and inflammatory markers in patients with type 1 diabetes.</p><sec id="s2"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>The study recruited 67 individuals with type 1 diabetes during routine appointments at the Norwegian Diabetic Centre. Inclusion criteria were <italic>1</italic>) age 18 to 60 years (inclusive), <italic>2</italic>) type 1 diabetes (&#x0003e;15-year duration), and <italic>3</italic>) normo- or microalbuminuria. All patients provided written informed consent. The study, which was approved by the regional ethics committee and the Norwegian Medicines Agency, was conducted as a parallel, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled prospective trial of 24-month duration. Patients in the active group were given 300 mg benfotiamine per day (Benfogamma, W&#x000f6;rwag Pharma GmbH).</p><p>We selected patients with type 1 diabetes of &#x0003e;15-year duration (mean 31-year duration) because we previously showed that these patients have reduced nerve conduction velocity (NCV) even if they do not have marked clinical neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Nerve conduction studies (NCS) were performed with Keypoint machines (Medtronic, Denmark) using surface electrodes with &#x0003e;45-min acclimatization (room temperature 22&#x02013;24&#x000b0;C). Examinations were performed by one of three neurophysiologists. Abnormal NCS were defined as one or more abnormal Z score in two or more nerves, based on sural nerve amplitude (antidromic stimulation), tibial and peroneal NCV, tibial amplitude, increased F-wave minimum latency (F-min), and absent F-waves (only considered abnormal in tibial nerve). F-wave persistence (<italic>N</italic> F-waves/<italic>N</italic> of stimuli) was based on 20 consecutive stimulations. Heart-rate response to deep breathing (6 breaths/min; supine position) relative to the mean heart rate during the same minute and the immediate heart-rate response to standing (30:15 ratio) was also calculated.</p><p>For clinical assessments, peripheral neuropathy was assessed by the diabetic neuropathy symptom score (DNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) and the neuropathy disability score (NDS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). This included examination of the ankle reflex, vibration sensation using a 128-Hz tuning fork, and pinprick sensation of the great toe. We assessed cutaneous pressure perception using a 10-g Semmes-Weinstein monofilament at four validated plantar sites.</p><p>Blood samples were drawn after an overnight fast (0800 and 1000 h), prepared within 1 h, and kept frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C for batch analysis (except thiamine derivatives and routine analyses).</p><sec id="s3"><title>Statistics</title><p>Means (95% CIs) are given for continuous normally distributed data and medians (quartiles) for highly skewed data. Differences between groups over 24 months were tested by two independent sample <italic>t</italic> tests or Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests. Power calculations based on our primary end point (peroneal NCV) indicated that at least 55 patients would be required (standardized difference 0.75; 80% power, 5% significance level). Changes from baseline to 24 months within each group were tested by paired <italic>t</italic> tests for normally distributed data; otherwise, Wilcoxon was used. Per-protocol data were used in the analysis. Analyses were performed with STATA/IC 11 and PASW Statistics for Windows.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s4"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s5"><title>Study completion and baseline characteristics</title><p>The study was completed by 59 of the 67 patients who were recruited.

However, we did not find any significant differences between the benfotiamine and placebo group. The difference between the current study and former studies that reported a positive effect of benfotiamine may be related to differences in the investigated populations. Symptomatic polyneuropathy was not an inclusion criterion in the current study (symptom scoring was not meaningful because most patients were asymptomatic). However, because the former studies did not report neurophysiologic function, we cannot exclude that the reported effect was related to symptom reduction and not improved nerve function per se. In support of this view, benfotiamine has been reported to have an antinociceptive effect in inflammatory and neuropathic pain models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, despite a marked improvement in thiamine status, long-term high-dose benfotiamine had no significant effect on peripheral nerve function or inflammatory markers in patients with type 1 diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
