To improve disease control and survival, a multidisciplinary approach that includes chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted therapy are necessary.</p><p>It is now well-known that radiotherapy after mastectomy decreases the 10-year recurrence rate by 10.6% and 20-year breast cancer-related death by 8.1% in node-positive breast cancer patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Adjuvant radiotherapy performed after chemotherapy is currently recommended because concurrent chemoradiotherapy did not show anobvious curative effect<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> and may increase severe adverse reactions.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Nevertheless, the best sequence of postoperative chemoradiotherapy is still unclear.</p><p>Delayed radiotherapy may increase the risk of local recurrence.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Livi et al<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>showed that the timing of radiotherapy did not affect local recurrences. For patients with &#x0003e;4 positive lymph nodes, the 10-year recurrence risk for sequential chemotherapy and radiotherapy was over 21%.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> However, the SECRAB trial found that the 5-year local recurrence rate of concurrent chemoradiotherapy was significantly decreased compared with the sequential therapy (2.8% and 5.1%).<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> In the ARCOSEIN study, all patients were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery but did not show any advantage, except for local-regional recurrence-free survival (LRFS) among patients with positive lymph nodes.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> Therefore, these studies suggest that concurrent chemoradiotherapy could increase the local control rate in patients with high recurrence risk after breast-conserving surgery, but the effect of concurrent chemoradiotherapy after mastectomy and axillary dissection is not clear. Recent studies have shown that sequential adjuvant chemoradiotherapy was mainly performed in patients with early-stage breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery,<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> rather than in those who underwent mastectomy and axillary surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup></p><p>In addition, modern chemotherapy protocols may lead to better outcomes. The sequential administration of taxanes significantly improves progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with positive lymph nodes.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> In addition, computed tomography (CT) simulation, and three-dimensional (3D) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) have been recently developed, improving outcomes,<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> but these technologies were not tested in previous studies in relation of chemotherapy timing.</p><p>A recent Chinese preliminary trial showed that 5-fluorouracil+epirubicin+cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel (FEC-D) given concurrently with IMRT increased the local control rate.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare the effects of late-course concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) versus sequential therapy (SCRT) after mastectomy and axillary surgery in locally advanced breast cancer.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Study design and patients</title><p>This was a randomized controlled trial that was carried out in female patients with breast cancer treated at the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University between January 2009 and December 2014.

All the patients completed the planned therapy. LRFS of patients with locally advanced invasive breast cancer after mastectomy and axillary surgery was better with CCRT than with SCRT and with similar profiles of adverse reactions. The DFS of patients staged pT3&#x02013;4 pN1&#x02013;3 cM0 was also improved.</p><p>In the present study, a significant difference in 3-year LRFS was observed between the CCRT and SCRT groups. Kim et al<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> reported a study on different chemoradiotherapy approaches after mastectomy for stage I&#x02013;IIIB breast cancer; they reported that there was no difference in LRFS, DFS, or OS between sequential and concurrent therapy. However, this previous study included early-stage low-risk patients and different chemotherapy regimens, probably influencing the results. In the present study, the patients in the pT3&#x02013;4 pN1&#x02013;3 cM0 subgroup had a better LRFS and DFS with CCRT than patients with pT1&#x02013;2 pN2&#x02013;3 cM0 cancer. This is supported by the study by Kim et al,<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> which indicated that concurrent chemoradiotherapy could improve the survival of patients with high-risk factors such as positive or close margins. Another study reported that concurrent radiotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) showed an increased local control rate compared with sequential therapy, especially for patients with large mass, multiple positive lymph nodes, and young patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> Therefore, concurrent chemoradiotherapy might be a good option for patients with high-risk locally advanced breast cancer after mastectomy and axillary surgery.</p><p>Radiation adverse reactions, especially radiation skin reaction, radiation pneumonitis, and myocardial damage, are the focus of attention when comparing different chemoradiotherapy approaches. In the SECRAB study, the occurrence rate of acute skin toxicity reaction in the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group was 24%, significantly higher than that of sequential therapy (15%), especially for grade 3 radiodermatitis.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Rouesse et al<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> compared CMF concurrent chemoradiotherapy with FEC sequential chemoradiotherapy; in the concurrent therapy group, febrile neutropenia was observed, grade 3&#x02013;4 leukopenia events were increased, and the occurrence rate of subclinical myocardial dysfunction was higher; furthermore, decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was more frequent 1 year after therapy. In the present study, both the CCRT and SCRT groups both showed good tolerance, no grade 3&#x02013;4 radiation adverse reaction occurred, and the occurrence rate of adverse reaction in the CCRT group was not significantly higher than that in the SCRT group. The development of modern radiotherapy approaches might be a key factor. Indeed, previous studies used CO<sup>60</sup> or 2D radiotherapy. Although it could meet the requirements of breast cancer radiotherapy, eventual hotspots generated by non-uniform doses could lead to acute or late-stage adverse reactions, especially radiation skin damage. In the present study, IMRT was used, which could effectively increase the uniformity of planned dosage and personalization to each individual's anatomy, ensuring that neighboring organs such as lung and heart do not receive a large dose of radiations. Indeed, a Canadian study of IMRT versus 2D approaches showed that the occurrence rate of acute skin wet dermatitis has significantly decreased with IMRT.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup></p><p>The selection of the drugs for concurrent chemoradiotherapy may also influence the outcomes. Anthracycline followed by a taxane is the current therapy recommended for high-risk patients with positive lymph nodes.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Nevertheless, hematotoxicity, radiation skin reaction, and cardiotoxicity are more common with an anthracycline-based therapy compared with other regimens. Ismaili et al<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> reported that anthracycline concurrent chemoradiotherapy improved the LRFS and DFS, but significantly increased hematological and non-hematological adverse reactions. Thus, avoiding concurrent radiotherapy and anthracycline might alleviate hematotoxicity, cutaneous reactions, and cardiotoxicity. Burstein et al<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> studied the adjuvant doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide (AC) regimen followed by 3-week paclitaxel or weekly paclitaxel concurrent with chemoradiotherapy; the dosage-limiting toxicity was evident in weekly paclitaxel concurrent therapy, and the occurrence rate of radiation pneumonitis was significantly increased. Another clinical trial studied AC with paclitaxel concurrent chemoradiotherapy and showed no serious adverse reactions during the 5-year follow-up.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> On the other hand, Chow et al<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> used FEC sequential weekly paclitaxel concurrent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, but 8 patients showed grade 3 radiation pneumonitis and 1 died from respiratory distress syndrome. Thus, the dose intensity of paclitaxel may influence adverse reactions.</p><p>In the present study, the CCRT group used radiotherapy only with the docetaxel as part of the chemotherapy, which avoided the concurrence with anthracycline. Previous studies showed that concurrent chemoradiotherapy was the best regimen for bi-weekly paclitaxel or 3-week docetaxel.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> We found in our current trial that the occurrence rates and degrees of hematotoxicity and radiation adverse reactions in the CCRT group showed no difference with the SCRT group. Compared with similar studies,<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> the radiation skin reactions were slight, without symptomatic heart and lung damage. However, due to the short follow-up, the influence of concurrent chemoradiotherapy on heart needs a longer follow-up time to be confirmed.</p><p>A previous study showed that breast cancer subtype is an independent prognostic factor.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> Another study found that the pathological remission rate of positive estrogen and progesterone receptor patients were different after paclitaxel concurrent neoadjuvant chemotherapy.<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> The influence of hormone receptors and HER2 positivity needs to be further explored.</p><p>The present study is not without limitations. The sample size was relatively small. The pathological diagnostic criteria of hormone receptor-positive changed during the period of enrollment. So in this paper did not discuss the receptor status of hormone. The follow-up was relatively short, and long-term follow-up should be contributed to assess adequately the differences between the 2 approaches in terms of LRFS, DFS, OS, and long-term toxicity.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>LRFS of patients with locally advanced invasive breast cancer after mastectomy and axillary surgery was better with CCRT than with SCRT and with similar profiles of adverse reactions. The DFS of patients staged pT3&#x02013;4 pN1&#x02013;3 cM0 was also improved. Nevertheless, the long-term effects and adverse reactions still need to be confirmed.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors would like to thank the patients and the members of the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University Oncology Department.
