OM and associated hearing loss persist from infancy throughout childhood and often into adulthood. Educational and social opportunities are greatly compromised. <italic>Pneumococcus</italic> and non-typeable <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> (NTHi) are major OM pathogens that densely colonise the nasopharynx and infect the middle ear from very early in life.

The blinded primary outcomes at 7&#x02005;months of age are immunogenicity of specific vaccine antigens (geometric mean concentration (GMC) and proportion of participants with above threshold GMC of 0.35&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/L). Secondary outcomes at all timepoints are additional immunogenicity measures and proportion of participants with nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine-type pneumococci and NTHi, and any OM, including any tympanic membrane perforation.

By 3&#x02005;months of age all infants have had a diagnosis of OM, and the episode persists for months.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Our studies have identified communities where as many as 60% of children under 2.5&#x02005;years of age have tympanic membrane perforations (TMP). Less than 20% children have normal aerated middle ears.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The conductive hearing loss associated with persistent middle ear effusion (around 25&#x02005;dB) or TMP (35&#x02013;60&#x02005;dB) has detrimental effects on auditory processing, speech and language development, behavioural and communication skills, and educational achievement. In randomised controlled trials, compared to placebo, long-term amoxicillin has been shown to halve the risk of TMP<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and long-term topical antibiotics will resolve the ear discharge (but not the perforation) in only 30% children.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Health services struggle to deal with the diagnosis of acute OM (AOM), and with the management of perforation or persistent hearing loss. Surgical options are rarely available. Strategies to prevent early ear disease or reduce the incidence, duration and severity of disease are urgently needed.</p><p>Onset of first OM is preceded by acquisition of bacterial pathogens that colonise the nasopharynx soon after birth.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The primary pathogens recovered from ear discharge of Aboriginal children with AOM with perforation (AOMwiP) in the first 18&#x02005;months of life are pneumococcus (Spn), and non-typeable <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> (NTHi). Pre-PCVs (pneumococcal conjugate vaccines) <italic>Pneumococcus</italic> was recovered from 38% middle ear discharge samples and NTHi from 55%.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Our research question is to determine the potential for the two licensed PVCs PHiD-CV10 and PCV13 to be used early and in combination to broaden protection from the OM pathogens. The combination schedule chosen (PHiD-CV10 at 1, 2 and 4&#x02005;months plus PCV13 at 6&#x02005;months) was based on (1) data showing improved HiD immunogenicity following a third dose of PHiD-CV10 compared to two doses (data provided by GSK), (2) the opportunity to start vaccination earlier, at 1&#x02005;month rather than 2&#x02005;months of age, (3) the Northern Territory's relatively low prevalence of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by PCV13-only serotypes 3, 6A and 19A (compared to other serotypes) and (4) data showing reasonable immune response to a single dose of PCV.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>If superior, the COMBO vaccine schedule is likely to be recommended for Indigenous infants living in high-risk populations.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Explanation for choice of comparators</title><p>Three PCVs were licensed or soon to be licensed in Australia at the time of writing this proposal in 2009. PCV7 had been effective in eradicating almost all OM episodes caused by the seven vaccine serotypes. However, this eradication had not been translated to a clinical benefit<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> due to replacement disease by non-PCV7 serotypes<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and a significant role of NTHi as a primary pathogen in TMP (<italic>Pneumococcus</italic> was recovered from around 31% middle ear discharge samples from PCV7-vaccinated children less than 18&#x02005;months of age and NTHi from 58%).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> We also believe persistent high rates of pneumonia in the Northern Territory<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> are not necessarily related to low efficacy of PCV7, but to serotype replacement and additional pathogens including NTHi, as shown in Papua New Guinea.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Extended coverage vaccines are urgently needed. One strategy with potential to extend serotype coverage has been addressed by another study of ours (NHMRC 490320 &#x02018;PneuMum&#x02019;),<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> which has evaluated maternal immunisation with Pneumovax (23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, 23PPV) to provide early and expanded serotype protection in Indigenous infants. In 2006, results of an RCT of 11-valent PCV (pneumococcal <italic>H. influenzae</italic> protein D conjugate vaccine, 11Pn-PD) showed efficacy for vaccine-type pneumococcal AOM and NTHi-AOM.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The 10-valent vaccine, PHiD-CV10, was licensed on the basis of immunogenicity of the pneumococcal antigens and in 2009 was under consideration by Therapeutic Goods Administration for recommendation in Australia. In October 2009, the Northern Territory was the only Australian jurisdiction to change recommendations for PCV from PCV7 at 2, 4 and 6&#x02005;months (followed by PPV23 at 18&#x02005;months for Indigenous children), to PHiD-CV10 at 2, 4, 6 and 18&#x02005;months (for all children). In 2011, the 13-valent CRM<sub>197</sub>-conjugated vaccine, Prevenar13, was approved in Australia as a 2, 4 and 6&#x02005;month schedule (followed by PCV13 at 18&#x02005;months for Indigenous children). In October 2011, Prevenar13 replaced PHiD-CV10 in the Northern Territory.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Objectives</title><p>Specific objectives or hypotheses.</p><sec id="s1c1"><title>Overall objective</title><p>To determine if the COMBO vaccination schedule is superior to the other two vaccination schedules with regard to overall protection from OM pathogens.</p><p>Primary hypotheses:

Assessments are made using a tympanometer (Grason Stadler GSI 38), a LumiView (Welch Allyn), and a video-otoscope (Welch Allyn macroview or MedRx video-otoscopes).</p><p>Definitions of OM: We categorise middle ear states as follows: (1) normal; (2) OM with effusion (OME); (3) acute OM without perforation (AOMwoP); (4) AOM with perforation (AOMwiP); (5) dry perforation and (6) chronic suppurative OM (CSOM). The final middle ear diagnosis reflects the child's most severely affected ear (highest category). Criteria for diagnosis are based on recommendations for clinical practice in this population<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>: (1) OME&#x02014;intact and non-bulging tympanic membrane (TM) and type B tympanogram; (2) AOMwoP&#x02014;any bulging of the TM and type B tympanogram; (3) AOMwiP&#x02014;middle ear discharge observed and TM perforation recently healed or present for less than 6&#x02005;weeks or covering less than 2% of the pars tensa of the TM; (4) dry perforation&#x02014;TM perforation without any discharge observed and (5) CSOM&#x02014;middle ear discharge observed and perforation present for longer than 6&#x02005;weeks and covering at least 2% of the pars tensa of the TM. Combination categories of any suppurative OM (any AOM, AOMwiP or CSOM) and any TMP (any AOMwiP, dry perforation or CSOM) are included. Where duration of discharge is not known, size of perforation is used to distinguish AOMwiP and CSOM. Where otosocopy is not successful the infant's tympanometry result is used and the infant's status is defined as OME if either ear had a type B tympanogram. We ask the mother if she thought her baby had ear pain that day or during the previous evening.

For the primary outcomes (immunogenicity), the collection method (heel prick or venepuncture) and volume of whole blood is recorded. For the nasopharyngeal swabs, the WHO recommendations are followed and swab quality is recorded according to a standardised category (good, fair, poor). For OM, a standardised form is used to record detailed clinical features of the diagnosis. Features include presence of wax, pus or foreign bodies in the canal, TM colour and translucency, position and degree of bulging, integrity and perforation size, amount of discharge. The final diagnosis for each ear is determined by the research nurse for purposes of disease management. Tympanometry is performed and results printed. Diagnostic algorithms are checked using the clinical feature scores and tympanogram. A video recording of the TM is used to assist the diagnostic decisions.</p><p>Retention: Participant retention till 7&#x02005;months of age is promoted through the eligibility criteria (intention of the family and infant to remain in the community) and encouragement at each interaction with the study staff.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Data management</title><p>Data collected during each study visit are recorded on standardised forms in participant workbooks. Paper forms are returned to the Menzies office and data entered electronically by the research nurse into a MySQL database with Microsoft Access front-end, within 1&#x02005;week of data collection. A protocol for changing data on paper according to Good Clinical Practice is used and all changes made electronically are tracked on the database. Microbiology data are entered directly onto the same MySQL database by the laboratory scientist. All data are checked using a series of logical checks and 10% of all electronic data are cross-checked with paper forms. An overall error rate of 1:200 precipitates a 100% check of targeted data fields and a further 10% check of all data.

Participant recruitment and retention, protocol deviations and violations, reactogenicity, adverse events and serious adverse events are regularly reviewed. Aggregate clinical and NP carriage outcomes, and adequacy of blood collection for immunogenicity outcomes are reported. A closed session is scheduled for the end of each iDSMB meeting. Further details can be found in the PREVIX_COMBO Trial Master File held on the Menzies secure server.</p><p>Interim analyses and stopping: There are no interim analyses planned. Stopping guidelines are based on safety alone and will be a decision made by the iDSMB according to the Terms of Reference. The iDSMB will hold an extraordinary meeting to discuss modification, suspension or termination of the trial on the grounds of safety. Interim independent analyses may be requested to establish whether the trial result has been attained or will not be able to be attained. Should it be felt necessary, the iDSMB may request interim independent analyses.</p><p>Harms: Standardised data collection forms are used to extract data from the medical records on adverse events (anticipated reactogenicity and unanticipated events), including hospitalisation. Adverse reactions are directly observed during postvaccination period of 15&#x02005;min. The iDSMB is informed about population trends in hospitalised cases of the disease potentially related to interventions or the probable-related adverse events. The NT Department of Health, Disease Control provides monthly data on cases of Invasive Pneumococcal Disease (total cases and cases of serotype 3, 6A and 19A by ethnicity, age and location). Notifications of hospitalised cases of bronchiolitis at Royal Darwin Hospital are also provided, as bronchiolitis is the most common cause of hospitalisation in the age group of this vaccine trial.

The goal is to acknowledge substantive contributions to design, conduct, interpretation and reporting of the trial through authorship, and to enhance transparency and avoid disputes or misunderstanding after trial completion. Protocol authors will be acknowledged in subsequent publications for their role in design. All NHMRC grant application chief investigators and associate investigators will be acknowledged as group authors for their role in funding, in addition to any additional individually-named authorship on the basis of criteria and approved by the Publication Subcommittee. All study staff who participate for at least one full-time year or equivalent will be named as a group author and acknowledged for their role. Where journals do not allow such groups to be acknowledged, this publication or the PREVIX_COMBO protocol will be cited as reference for the full authorship group.</p></sec><sec id="s3j"><title>Committees</title><p>The Child Health Division of the Menzies School of Health Research has convened an Indigenous Reference Group (CHD_IRG), chaired by Professor Ngiare Brown.
