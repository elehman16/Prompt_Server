Evidence suggests that prescribing in this population can be potentially inappropriate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Medications are termed potentially inappropriate where their risks outweigh the benefits and when a safer therapeutic alternative is available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP) is estimated to affect between 10 and 50&#x000a0;% of community dwelling older people internationally, increasing the risk of morbidity, ADEs, hospitalisations and health expenditure in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Interventions such as computerised decision support systems (CDSS), pharmacist interventions and multifaceted interventions may be useful strategies in reducing PIP in different health care settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We have previously demonstrated that a multifaceted intervention was effective in decreasing PIP in older patients in primary care using a short-term follow-up, on intervention completion at 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The short-term results indicated that patients in the intervention group had significantly lower odds of having PIP than patients in the control group (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.32, 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 0.70, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02). The mean number of PIP drugs in intervention was 0.70, compared to 1.18 in control (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02). The intervention was effective in reducing proton pump inhibitor prescribing (adjusted OR 0.30, 95&#x000a0;% CI 0.14 to 0.68, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04), but not other drug classes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">The use of such short-term follow-up is a common criticism, raising concerns about the long-term sustainability of such interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Even when inappropriate medications are ceased, evidence indicates that they might be restarted, particularly where multiple prescribers are involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Post-trial follow-up is therefore recommended to assess if short-term changes persist. Post-trial follow-up is necessary to assess if trial effects diminish, remain constant or increase after the randomised interventions are formally discontinued. The objective of this study was to determine whether the immediate improvement in PIP in the short-term was sustained at 1&#x000a0;year follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par10">A cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in Irish primary care to alter general practitioner (GP) PIP-related prescribing.

In total, 196 patients were recruited. Fifty-three per cent of the pre-specified indicators were present in this population. Practices were allocated using minimisation to intervention or control after baseline data collection. It was not possible to blind patients or GPs to allocations; however, the outcome assessor was blinded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Intervention and control groups</title><p id="Par12">The intervention group (11 practices, 99 patients) received a multifaceted intervention involving academic detailing with a pharmacist on how to conduct GP-led medicines review with participating patients.

Our findings substantiate previous findings that have demonstrated that interventions lasting for a limited time period (e.g. educational and multifaceted interventions) can have a long-lasting carry-over effect on improving PIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">An array of factors may have contributed to the sustained effect observed in this study. Firstly, this cohort of older patients experienced few hospitalisations over the 1-year follow-up period, reducing the potential for medication changes or potential errors to arise at these transitions of care (i.e. moving between primary and secondary care) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Hence, prescribing may have been more likely to stay stable over time. Secondly, the effect may also have been maintained due to the medications in question, particularly prescribing of proton pump inhibitors, which may be easier to maintain than other medications. Finally, the intervention itself may be an influential factor. Patients were identified as having PIP which would have been noted in the patient health care record; therefore, at future consultations, GPs may be more cognisant of not restarting the identified PIP. A combination of these factors may have contributed to the persistence of the effect from this one-off intervention.</p><p id="Par23">The OPTI-SCRIPT intervention primarily affected potentially inappropriate proton pump inhibitor prescribing, which was highly prevalent at baseline (60&#x000a0;%). We found no impact on other included medications (e.g. benzodiazepines), likely because of the small numbers of patients exposed to these PIP drugs in this study. The prescription of inappropriate proton pump inhibitor is a substantial driver for the prevalence of PIP both in Ireland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and internationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The use of proton pump inhibitors has increased substantially during the past decade internationally, potentially due to increased long-term use for ulcer prophylaxis and perceived lack of serious adverse side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, a significant proportion of this prescribing has been found to be inappropriate, and consequently, there has been an increased focus on reducing inappropriate use to improve patient outcomes and decrease costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of OPTI-SCRIPT intervention and control groups</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Intervention</th><th>The intervention consisted of:</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td/><td>(1) Academic detailing with a pharmacist<break/>One session (30&#x000a0;min) where a pharmacist visited the practice to discuss PIP, medicine review and the web-based pharmaceutical treatment algorithms<break/>(2) Medicine review with web-based pharmaceutical treatment algorithms.

</p><p id="Par24">A small proportion of the intervention group (13&#x000a0;%) had new PIP at 1-year follow-up, though this was lower than those in the control group (20&#x000a0;%), suggesting some effect on GP prescribing in the intervention practices. The new instances of PIP in intervention practices mainly related to sustained maximal dosage of proton pump inhibitors. From the data presented here, it is unclear if the proton pump inhibitor was indeed appropriate or if it was initiated by the GP or another physician. Proton pump inhibitors initiated in hospitals are frequently continued in primary care, even when inappropriate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">Improvements may be observed in control group participants due to reactive effects of being studied (i.e. the possible Hawthorne effect). The control group in this study did alter their prescribing patterns slightly. This may be explained by the fact that during the intervention, they received simple feedback about their patients based on baseline data collection and a report on patient PIP at intervention completion. Feedback has been found to promote slight improvements in professional practice but is most effective when it is provided intensively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In anticipation of this improvements in the control group occurring, we analysed anonymised data from the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) pharmacy claim database of dispensed medications (a national prescribing database of GP and pharmacy claims), as a national contemporaneous comparison group. Analysis of this group highlighted that the crude odds of having PIP were lower in the OPTI-SCRIPT intervention group compared to the national comparator group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">The study has a number of strengths, including being conducted in &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; practices, the low rate of attrition of from the study (primarily due to the nature of the outcome data) and the completeness of the prescription data. However, there are some limitations including the geographic restriction to a region in Ireland, limiting external validity. In all, 32&#x000a0;% of invited GP practices were recruited which is lower than that reported in other primary care studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The intervention was effective at decreasing the most prevalent PIP in this study, proton pump inhibitors at maximum therapeutic dosage for more than 8&#x000a0;weeks. Potentially inappropriate proton pump inhibitor is a problem in Ireland and internationally, indicating that this intervention could be generalizable to other settings. However, it has been argued that future studies of PIP should focus on the management of genuinely high-risk medicines (i.e. prescribing likely to lead to adverse clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]), rather than global lists of potentially inappropriate medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. It is therefore important to establish the effectiveness of the OPTI-SCRIPT intervention in altering prescribing, other than proton pump inhibitor prescribing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par27">Changes in PIP occur against a background of escalating polypharmacy and changes in prescribing patterns of specific medications over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]; however, these findings indicate that improvements in prescribing quality can be maintained over time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Abbreviations</title><p id="Par28">CI, confidence interval; GP, general practitioner; ICGP, Irish College of General Practitioners; OR, odds ratio; PIP, potentially inappropriate prescribing; RCT, randomised controlled trial</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec13"><title>Appendix</title><p id="Par33">
