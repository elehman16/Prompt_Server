The use of amalgam is decreasing due to poor aesthetic properties and concerns regarding mercury toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Composites fillings are becoming the reference for direct restorations since the current controversy on the abrasive effect of glass ionomers cements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>In posterior deep cavities, pulp health sometimes needs to be re-evaluated several months after a repair process. In such clinical situations, the biocompatible dentine substitute can be used first as a posterior restoration to obtain pulp healing. After validation of pulp health, it can be partially removed to place a permanent composite material in order to avoid bacteria exposure.</p><p>A new dental material, the tricalcium silicate based Biodentine could be both a temporary enamel restoration and a definitive dentine substitute. Its good sealing properties, high compression strengths and short setting time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] are suggestive of its potential as a restorative material.</p><p>The aim of the study was to determine for how long Biodentine can remain as a restorative material submitted to occlusal chewing forces and how it can be managed in combination with a composite restoration. The resin-based composite Z100&#x000ae;, which has been in clinical use for the restoration of posterior teeth for more than a decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], was used as a comparator.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and patients</title><p>This was a multicentric, randomized, prospective study which started in 2005, with a 3-year follow-up that was still ongoing at the time of this interim analysis. A total of 400 patients were estimated necessary to obtain at least 100 exploitable observations in each treatment group at M6 (6&#x000a0;months). Patients were recruited in the department of operative dentistry at two French university hospitals (Service d&#x02019;Odontologie Gaston Berger, CHU de Marseille, Marseille and Service d'Odontologie Garanci&#x000e8;re-Rothschild, Paris). Ten investigators from two centers received training in Good Clinical Practice and on tooth models with Biodentine before the first inclusion. As the manipulation of Biodentine was not different from commonly used products, a special training of the investigators was not considered necessary. The protocol, its amendments and the informed consent form were approved by an Independent Ethics Committee (IEC Sud M&#x000e9;diterran&#x000e9;e, France). The study was declared to the French Health competent authority (AFSSAPS) and registered under the reference number 2004/12/013. The study was conducted following the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the international consensus guideline (ICH) for Good Clinical Practice. Patients gave their informed, written consent prior to study enrolment.</p><p>Patients eligible to participate were between 18 and 80&#x000a0;years of age and had one or two indications for definitive occlusal or occluso-proximal restorations on vital posterior teeth from the first premolar to the third molar, with class I and II cavities, as evaluated with radiographs. A pulp vitality test was performed to exclude irreversible damage.</p><p>Non-inclusion criteria were non-vital teeth, contraindication to treatment with Biodentine or Z100&#x000ae; (3&#x000a0;M Z100&#x000ae; Restorative Dental Composite), allergy or hypersensitivity to an element of Biodentine or Z100&#x000ae;, serious periodontal problems, no desire for definitive restoration, and previous treatment with radiotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study procedures and study outcome</title><p>Patients were randomly assigned to receive either Biodentine or the comparator product Z100&#x000ae; using Microsoft&#x000ae; Office Excel&#x000ae; software. Restoration was performed on D0 (day 0). Cavity preparation was carried out with a diamond bur (shape 830) according to the requirements for a direct composite restoration.</p><p>For the Z100&#x000ae; group, an adhesive system (All Bond 2, Bisco, IL, USA) was applied and then light-cured for 10&#x000a0;s, using a daily controlled light curing unit (Satelec, F, 800&#x000a0;mW/cm<sup>2</sup>). After repeated air flow, Z100&#x000ae; was applied using a horizontal incremental placement technique (maximum: 2&#x000a0;mm thickness layer). Increments were light-cured for 20&#x000a0;s according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.</p><p>Biodentine is a high purity Ca<sub>3</sub>SiO<sub>5</sub>-based dental material (Laboratoires Septodont, Saint-Maur, France) composed of a solid part containing tricalcium silicate (3CaO&#x000b7;SiO<sub>2</sub>), calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) and zirconium oxide (ZrO<sub>2</sub>) and a liquid part containing calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>&#x000b7;2H<sub>2</sub>O), and a water reducing agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Both parts were provided in single-dose units. Five drops of liquid were added to the powder single unit. After mixing 30&#x000a0;s at 4,000&#x02013;4,200&#x000a0;rpm, Biodentine was applied as such without requiring any surface treatment.</p><p>A control radiograph was taken after the procedure. Follow-up visits were scheduled for D15, M6, M12, M24, and M36 and included a clinical evaluation and a radiographic examination.</p><p>The study outcomes were material performance and material safety and were assessed at each visit. Material performance was assessed by evaluating characteristics of the product application, including consistency, working time (i.e., whether the duration for preparation and application the material was adequate), adhesion to instruments, and ease of handling. Furthermore the characteristics of the restoration, including anatomic form of the restoration, marginal adaptation, quality of proximal contact, marginal discoloration, surface roughness, secondary decay, and post-operative pain were analysed.</p><p>Since the main objective was to evaluate for how long Biodentine could be used as a long term temporary posterior restoration, criteria were selected from the USPHS. However, in this indication some criteria were not relevant.</p><p>The following scoring scales were used for these evaluations:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Consistency, working time, adhesion to instruments, ease of handling (0 to 3): 0= very satisfying; 1= satisfying; 2= unsatisfying, 3= very unsatisfying.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Anatomic form (0 to 3): 0= restoration is continuous with existing form; 1= restoration is discontinuous, without exposure of the dentine or base; 2= part of restoration missing, enough to expose the dentine; 3= partial or total restoration loss, fracture, traumatic occlusion, pain in tooth or surrounding tissue.

If one of the criteria received an unacceptable score, the restoration was considered a failure and a new Z100&#x000ae; restoration was placed. The scores of the two restorative materials were compared using the following non-parametric tests: Friedman test complemented with Wilcoxon <italic>t</italic>-test to evaluate the influence of time on the material (correction of p-values for multiple comparison); Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test to evaluate the material at each time point as chi-square frequency method criteria were not fulfilled.

Cases were distributed in 77 (36.3%) Class I cavities and 135 (63.7%) Class II cavities. The distribution between molars and premolars was 64 (30.2%) and 148 (69.8%), respectively. Ninety-six patients with a mean age of 36 (&#x000b1;14) years received a restoration with Biodentine and 116 patients with a mean age of 39 (&#x000b1;14) years received Z100&#x000ae;.

This situation was confirmed at 1-year visit. During the follow-up of the first cases, it appeared that Biodentine was abraded and required an additional restoration with Z100&#x000ae;. At the interim evaluation, results showed that 80 cases underwent an additional restoration. Twenty-five percent of cases occurred before the 6-month visit, 30% between 6&#x000a0;months and 1&#x000a0;year and 46% after 1&#x000a0;year (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The reason for placing a composite over the Biodentine was mainly abrasion (on the occlusal surface or on the proximal contact).

Therefore, the second step of the study was to determine the efficacy of Biodentine covered with Z100&#x000ae;. It was found that the Biodentine restoration was well tolerated as all patients tested had a positive pulp vitality test. Biodentine was cut back using dental burs, but preserved as a dentine substitute in order to avoid bacterial infiltration through dentine tubules. The resistance of Biodentine to be cut back was found to be very satisfactory. Almost all investigators rated the complementary treatment procedure as very satisfactory. The evaluation of anatomic form, marginal adaptation, proximal contact, the resistance to marginal discoloration, surface roughness, the absence of secondary caries, and post-operative pain yielded very satisfactory scores throughout the study.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Occurrence of Z100&#x000ae; complementary treatment on Biodentine cases.

Importantly, the material did not affect human pulp fibroblast specific functions such as mineralization, as well as expression of collagen I, dentine sialoprotein and Nestin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Biodentine may enhance the repair and pulp healing in case of partial impairment of the odontoblastic layer. Given the mechanical properties of Biodentine, we expected it to be a posterior restorative material in clinical situations where the evaluation of pulp healing is required before a definitive restoration.</p><p>In the present trial, Biodentine received good rates for material handling and performance after restoration placement. Two evaluation criteria with excellent ratings for both materials were absence of post-operative pain and secondary decay. Post-operative pain is frequently observed in class I and II restorations in posterior teeth with resin-based materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In our study almost all patients analysed were free of post-operative pain. Only one case of secondary caries was reported in the Biodentine group after a 1-year follow-up. This case was due to the loss of the material. No other adverse events were observed after Biodentine application. Another common problem observed in posterior composite restorations is marginal discoloration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. We found that Biodentine had significantly better scores for this characteristic compared to Z100&#x000ae;. However, it has to be kept in mind that this is an interim study and that only a subset of patients had completed the 3-year follow-up.</p><p>At this interim analysis, Z100&#x000ae; had better scores for anatomic form, marginal adaptation and proximal contact than Biodentine at the 6-month recall. This situation was confirmed at the 1-year recall. Moreover, during the follow-up of the first cases, it appeared that some abrasion process occurred on Biodentine restorations for 25% before 6&#x000a0;months and 30% between 6&#x000a0;months and 1&#x000a0;year. Although the deficiencies of marginal adaptation required a new restoration, no marginal discoloration occurred. Therefore, it was decided to systematically add the composite on top of Biodentine for the next visit in the other cases. Then, it was the second step of the clinical study: the evaluation of Biodentine as a dentine substitute combined with direct composite restoration.</p><p>When Biodentine was used as a dentine substitute combined with direct composite restoration, we found it to be easily cut back with a dental bur at partial removal stage. A thick layer was left in place as a dentine substitute in order to preserve biological and sealing effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The addition of Z100&#x000ae; was carried out using the sandwich technique. This may constitute a therapeutic advantage for patients, especially for large cavities where the risk of secondary caries is increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This approach may help to preserve tooth structure and improve the longevity of the restoration. Importantly, this treatment resulted in very satisfactory restoration performance.</p><p>To conclude, regarding handling properties and behavior in stress bearing conditions of posterior teeth, Biodentine can be successfully used as a posterior restoration material for up to 6&#x000a0;months. At this time, abrasion is the main degradation process without any marginal discoloration. Thus, the clinical relevance of this study is the ability to use Biodentine as a dentine substitute under a composite for posterior restoration.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to thank the following collaborators for their participation in this study: Drs.
