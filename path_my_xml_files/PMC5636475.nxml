For each patient the two areas were defined as study and control following randomization. The SVF was applied over the study area after debridement and then covered by a hyaluronic acid scaffold. The control area was covered with the scaffold. Both areas were left untouched for 15 days, at which time point they were first blindly assessed by histogram planimetry wound area tracing.<sup>4</sup> Further assessments were made at 20, 25, 30 and 180 days. If any of the study or control areas had not shown signs of significant healing by the 20 days-follow up, they were covered with a split-thickness autologous skin graft. At 15 days biopsies were taken from both the study and control areas to assess for CD31 expression by immunohistochemistry. Vancouver Scar Scale and patient satisfaction VAS were also recorded at the 180 days follow up. Adverse events and complications were monitored at each visit.</p><p><bold>RESULTS:</bold> Each treated area showed presence of islands of reepithelization and subtotal healing at 15 days, and complete healing at 30 days in all cases. Each control area failed to heal spontaneously and underwent coverage with a split thickness autologous skin graft in all cases. CD31 immunohistochemistry examination to assess for angiogenesis showed an increased mean vascularity in the case areas when compared to the control ones. No adverse events were recorded.</p><p><bold>CONCLUSION:</bold> Our experience indicates a significant wound healing with the SVF in intermediate-deep burns. Such &#x0201c;spontaneous&#x0201d; healing saves the patient further surgery, which would be instead be needed to cover the defect with a skin graft, and leads to better long term cosmetic outcomes. Therefore an advantage in terms of patient morbidity (less surgery, less blood transfusion needed), quality of life and healthcare costs is easily foreseeable when applying this technique. This is a pilot study with a limited cohort. Further observations will be needed to confirm our results.</p><sec><title>Reference Citations:</title><p>1.
