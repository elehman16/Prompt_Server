The aim of this study was to investigate whether the addition of low-dose clonidine to intrathecal bupivacaine and fentanyl increased the duration of effective analgesia, as compared to a mixture of bupivacaine-fentanyl or bupivacaine-clonidine in gynecological surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>After obtaining the Institutional Research and Ethics Committee approval, written informed consent for this randomized, double-blind trial was obtained from 75 healthy female patients, scheduled to undergo vaginal hysterectomy with pelvic floor repair or non-descent vaginal hysterectomy (NDVH) under subarachnoid block. ASA grade I-II patients, with height ranging between 150 cm and 160 cm, were included in the study.</p><p>The patients were premedicated with oral alprazolam 0.25 mg at night and two hours prior to the surgery. In the Operating Room, the baseline parameters (pulse, blood pressure, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and EKG) were recorded and intravenous infusion was started withRinger's Lactate solution administered at the rate of 10 ml/kg prior to the subarachnoid block. The patients were randomized to one of the following three groups:</p><p>

</p><p>The total amount of the intrathecal mixture was constant (2.8 ml) in all the groups.</p><p>Under all aseptic precautions, a subarachnoid block was performed in the L3-L4 or L4-L5 interspace using a 25G Quincke spinal needle in the lateral position. The patients were randomly assigned to one of the three groups by the second author, using computer-generated random numbers, which were contained in a sealed envelope. This was handed over to another anesthesiologist drawing up the study drug in an unlabeled, sterile syringe. The intrathecal procedure, including administration of the drug, was done by the first author who remained blinded to its contents. Patient assessment and observations were also recorded by this blinded researcher in the Operation Theater as well as in the Recovery Room. The measured variables included the pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure (MAP), onset, level, duration, and regression of the sensory and motor block, quality of analgesia, and sedation. The measurements were recorded every two minutes for the initial 10 minutes, every five minutes for the next 20 minutes, and subsequently every 15 minutes till the end of surgery. The level of the sensory blockade was assessed using a 25G short bevel needle and recorded as loss of sensation to pin prick. The onset of the sensory block and time taken for two-segment regression of the block and regression to L1 were noted. The onset of the sensory block was taken from the time of the intrathecal injection till the time the highest level of the block was achieved. Duration of the sensory block was taken from the time of maximum sensory block till regression of the block to L1. The sensory spread was calculated as the number of dermatomal segments blocked from S5.</p><p>The quality of intraoperative analgesia was evaluated by the patient at 30-minute intervals using the following four-point scale (1 &#x02014; excellent analgesia, no sensation at all from the surgical site; 2 &#x02014; adequate analgesia, sensation of motion only; 3 &#x02014; inadequate analgesia, discomfort, but the patient declines additional analgesia; 4 &#x02014; major discomfort, additional analgesics are necessary).[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] When the patient complained of major discomfort, which mainly occurred at the time of pulling of the uterus, repeated boluses of 25 &#x003bc;g IV fentanyl (&#x02264;100 &#x003bc;g) were administered by the anesthesiologist monitoring the patient. General anesthesia was administered when the intraoperative pain score exceeded score 4 (major discomfort, additional analgesics are necessary) and the patients remained uncomfortable despite being given 100 &#x003bc;g fentanyl. The motor block was determined according to the modified Bromage scale<sup>3</sup> (ranging from 0 = no motor block to 3 = complete motor block of both lower limbs). Duration of the motor blockade was taken from the time of intrathecal injection till no motor weakness could be detected.</p><p>All the patients were administered oxygen via a Ventimask. Ringer's Lactate was given in calculated doses according to the weight of the patient and period of fasting and adjusted as per blood loss during surgery. A fall of MAP by 30% of the baseline was treated with rapid infusion of 200 ml of Ringer's Lactate and 3 mg aliquots of injection mephentermine intravenously, in case there was no response to fluid administration. Bradycardia (&#x0003c;50/minute) was treated with intravenous atropine sulfate. The presence of side effects like nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and shivering were noted. Sedation was recorded using a graded score (ranging from 0 = awake to 5 = eyes closed, but unarousable to mild physical stimulation).[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Severity of pain was assessed at 30 minutes, one hour, two hours, four hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours postoperatively, using a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS). The patients were given a rescue analgesic in the form of intramuscular diclofenac sodium (75 mg) when the VAS exceeded four; and the time of administration of the first as well as subsequent injections in 24 hours was noted. Duration of effective analgesia was taken from the time of intrathecal injection till the administration of the first rescue analgesic. The presence of any other side effect in the postoperative period was noted.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using the duration of effective analgesia as the primary outcome, with the Megastat software. Taking alpha 0.05 and sample size of 25 in each group, Power of the study was 70%. The Kruskal Wallis test was used to compare categorical data and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used for variable data.

The incidence of intraoperative pain and requirement of postoperative analgesics is significantly less with the addition of clonidine to the intrathecal mixture. One of the limitations of our study was the small sample size. Although certain trends could be established in this pilot study, further controlled, large sample-sized studies are required to confirm the results.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
