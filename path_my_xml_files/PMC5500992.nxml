However, an even more effective strategy for managing physical frailty might be the combination of multicomponent exercise with the intake of high-quality protein supplements, but the efficacy remains unclear for older adults who are already pre-frail and frail. The aim is to examine the feasibility of recruiting frail older adults to participate in a trial designed to determine the potential effects of a 6-month exercise and nutrition intervention on physical function. The feasibility objectives will include frail older peoples&#x02019; compliance, the safety and tolerability of the trial, the estimation of estimates to aid sample size calculation, and the potential efficacy. Primary outcomes for the main trial will include gait speed, grip strength and physical performance. Secondary outcomes will include frailty status, muscle mass, nutritional intake, physical activity levels, cognitive performance and quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">A randomised, parallel, control pilot and feasibility study will be conducted. All participants will be randomly assigned to either (a) an exercise program + high-quality protein supplement or (b) an exercise program + low-quality protein supplement. Both protein supplements will be matched closely in colour, flavour and packaging so that both the participants and the research staff are blinded. The exercise program will be the same in both groups. Assessments will be conducted at baseline and at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months and include gait speed, grip strength, the Short Physical Performance Battery, Timed Up and Go Test, FRAIL Screen, bioelectrical impedance analyses, 24-h dietary recall, Katz Activities of Daily Living, Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, the Trail Making Test, Short Form Health Survey-36, and 1&#x000a0;week accelerometer quantification. The data will be analysed using an ANCOVA model.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This study is expected to provide much needed insight into the feasibility of recruiting and retaining frail older adults into community-based intervention programs, while providing knowledge relating to the safety, tolerability and benefits of a combined exercise and protein supplement program designed to halt or reverse the transition of physical frailty in the community. If shown to be effective, this strategy could be included in the best practice clinical guidelines for community-dwelling older adults who are pre-frail or frail.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=370522">ACTRN12616000521426</ext-link>

In Australia, it is estimated that approximately 10 million people will be aged over 65&#x000a0;years by 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A common geriatric syndrome associated with ageing is frailty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Frailty is defined as a &#x0201c;clinically recognisable state of increased vulnerability resulting from age-associated decline in reserve and function&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and results in increased morbidity, including disability, loss of independence, increased hospitalizations and reduced quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. While frailty is measured using different scales, one of the most commonly used instruments is the Fried Frailty Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], which defines frailty according to a physical phenotype consisting purely of physical components. This construct of a physical phenotype is regarded as being distinct from disability or co-morbidity, and hence, the Frailty Index is considered to be highly predictive of future decline in physical health.</p><p id="Par19">Due to the appreciation of the Fried Frailty Index as a relatively easy tool with which to determine whether a person is physically frail, there have been a number of studies that have described the prevalence of this phenotype in different regions around the world. The Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) surveyed older adults across Europe and Israel using the Fried criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and the prevalence of frailty was reported to be 17% (range from 5.8% in Switzerland to 27.3% in Spain) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Data from a longitudinal cohort of Australian women using similar frailty criteria reported the same prevalence of pre-frail and frail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and, by 2050, this is estimated to represent four million Australians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These data provide impetus for the development of strategies that can be used to either halt or reverse the transition of physical frailty and the manifestation of poor health outcomes. Otherwise, increasing poor health and healthcare costs among this population cannot be mitigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">While physical frailty appears to be reversible when early intervention is provided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], there remains a lack of consensus regarding the management of older people who are frail or have complex health conditions. Evidence indicates that exercise is critical in managing many of the physiological changes that occur as individuals&#x02019; age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Exercise interventions, particularly those that include resistance training, have the potential to prevent, delay and reverse frailty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. For example, numerous studies have demonstrated that exercise maintains and restores one or more health parameters including muscle strength, bone integrity, balance and physical function in study populations that include older people who were relatively healthy (i.e. those without a clinical diagnosis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and those classified as frail according to a variety of methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, the strength of the evidence from meta-analyses regarding the benefits of exercise for frail older people was limited by the fact that many of the studies reviewed included small and heterogeneous study populations. Few studies have simultaneously measured markers of muscle mass, strength and function; the type of control activity used as the comparator for an exercise intervention has been highly variable; and the compliance to programs has not been well reported. In addition, a study of 151 community-living pre-frail and frail older adults in Singapore showed that improvements in frailty status and a variety of biomarkers of physical frailty were largely comparable for the nutrition, physical, cognitive and combined treatments and all resulted in greater improvement compared with the control, i.e. standard care from health and aged care services in combination with a placebo nutritional supplement. However, while there were no statistically significant differences between the nutrition, physical, cognitive and combined treatments, the improvements in all measured domains where greatest with the physical and combined groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Accordingly, more studies are needed to identify feasible exercise programs, alone and in combination with other treatments, for community-dwelling pre-frail and frail older adults.</p><p id="Par21">With respect to the nutritional management of pre-frail and frail older people, very few studies have been conducted to determine the effects of protein supplements, either on their own or in combination with exercise. Numerous studies have demonstrated substantial benefits of protein supplementation in combination with resistance exercise in healthy older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, only three studies have been conducted in frail older adults and have yielded conflicting results for the benefits of protein on muscle mass and markers of strength and mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. One study reported increased mobility, but no increase in skeletal muscle mass or strength when consuming additional protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], while another showed that protein supplements do not increase the effects of high-intensity functional exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Yet another concluded that resistance training, when combined with protein intake, did lead to increased muscle mass compared to resistance training alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Discrepant findings are likely to be the results of differences in study protocols and participants, with some study samples being too small, while others provided insufficient protein or administered the protein as a single bolus dose, or did not control for differences in background diet.</p><p id="Par22">In addition to the aforementioned limitations of previous research conducted in the ageing field, another major issue are the varied tools used to identify pre-frail and frail older adults. There remains little agreement regarding the diagnostic test accuracy of any of the simple, common diagnostic tests for community-dwelling people. Although interest in the FRAIL Screen is increasing for a number of reasons, this quick, simple screening tool does not require measurements by health professionals and has been validated in various populations across the globe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. It includes five questions about fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illness and weight loss, representing the phenotypic definition for frailty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The FRAIL Screen can be completed in 15&#x000a0;s. The brevity and simplicity make it useful as a screening tool for implementation in primary care, and it is said to be capable of detecting changes in frailty bidirectionally, and thus may be useful in monitoring for change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Given the incompleteness of our knowledge relating to the efficacy of protein supplements in combination with exercise interventions on physical function in people aged 65&#x000a0;years and older and who are recognised as pre-frail/frail, more information is required. Without a fuller understanding of the effects of a supplement-exercise regimen on frail community-dwelling older adults, it will continue to be difficult, if not impossible, to successfully manage their condition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aim</title><p id="Par24">The primary aim of this 6-month study is to report on the feasibility of recruiting frail adults aged 65&#x000a0;years and older using the FRAIL screen (e.g. source, speed) and retaining them for the entire 6-month intervention (e.g. compliance, safety, tolerability).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Feasibility objectives</title><p id="Par25">The feasibility objectives will include the recruitment of pre-frail and frail older people from the community using several recruitment channels, how well pre-frail and frail older people comply with the exercise and nutritional components of the intervention, their completion of the baseline, 3- and 6-month assessments and the safety and tolerability of the intervention.

The biostatistician will then notify the dietician on the allocated arm prior to the start of the intervention.

The exercise regimen includes one centre-based group exercise and two home-based exercise sessions, in addition to walking twice a week. During holiday periods or periods of illness, centre-based exercise can be missed, but participants will be asked to do an additional home-based exercise session if possible. These flexible approaches to the exercise regimen will be recorded.</p><p id="Par41">The exercise prescription is based on the LIFE study, a physical activity intervention for community-dwelling frail older people conducted in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Multi-component exercises incorporating strength, balance, aerobics and flexibility were selected from the LIFE Study and modified for this pilot intervention. Strength exercises will be performed using own body weight, elastic exercise bands and ankle weights. The aerobic modality will be performed using walking exercise. The balance modality will include at least two balance tasks, and the flexibility modality will include the upper and lower extremities. Exercises that are safe and that can be executed in a sitting or safe standing position will be prescribed for the home-based exercise program. Additional exercises that may require more supervision will be included in the centre-based exercise sessions. The intensity of the exercises is based on the LIFE Study design using the Borg Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The Borg Scale allows a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and can be used to monitor and control the intensity of exercise interventions. Strength exercises will be conducted at 15&#x02013;16 RPE, and walking will be conducted at 12&#x02013;14 RPE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Nutrition intervention</title><p id="Par42">A qualified dietician will provide the nutrition prescription and instruct participants on how to prepare and consume the protein supplements and how to record them in the provided compliance diaries. All protein supplements will be provided as a powder in individual 26-g sachets to provide 20&#x000a0;g of protein. The protein powder (i.e. whey or rice protein) will be blended with a powdered flavour (i.e. vanilla) and reconstituted in ~150&#x000a0;ml of water by the participants at home. All drinks will be isocaloric (i.e. both supplying ~90&#x000a0;kcal per 26&#x000a0;g protein sachet) and isonitrogenous (~3.5&#x000a0;g of nitrogen per 26&#x000a0;g protein sachet) and of comparable taste, texture and aroma. The protein powder will be packaged in identical pharmaceutical grade silver foil sachets marked with an A or B to ensure that participants and the study coordinator and research staff performing all study assessments are blinded.</p><p id="Par43">The protein load, source and timing of consumption are based on the recommendations by the PROT-AGE group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and the aforementioned meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Splitting the total load of protein into two supplements per day is based on evidence that a load of 20&#x000a0;g when combined with multicomponent exercise is sufficient to increase muscle protein synthesis in healthy, non-frail older people. During periods of hospitalisation, research staff will interact with the participant and treating health professionals to encourage, where safe to do so, continuation with the supplementation. Also, it is anticipated that participants will take sachets with them on holidays, thus continuing with supplementation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Screening and assessments</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Screening</title><p id="Par44">Participants will be screened for eligibility over the phone using the FRAIL Screen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and demographic- and health-related information will be collected.

These analyses will be estimated in an ANCOVA model with the 3- and 6-month value as outcome, and the baseline value age, gender and frailty status as covariates. The resulting treatment effect will be reported as the least square mean and 95% confidence interval for the primary outcomes of gait speed, grip strength and physical performance.

It directly, and also indirectly through increased disability, contributes to increased health and aged care costs of elderly populations around the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Frailty is a continuum of accumulated lifetime assaults on the body that compromises physical and/or mental equilibrium, predisposing older adults to increased dependency on healthcare resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Adults who are identified as being pre-frail have an increased risk over the next 3 to 4&#x000a0;years of becoming frail, requiring greater support in performing activities of daily living and maintaining independence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This means the early detection of frailty is pivotal for timely interventions that may assist in managing this geriatric condition and reducing healthcare costs, and to date, there remains a paucity of information about lifestyle interventions that may be beneficial for this target population.</p><p id="Par55">While exercise in combination with protein supplementation has been shown to positively impact a variety of physical and/or psychological health attributes in pre-frail and/or frail older people, several aspects related to the study design of previous research still limit the interpretation of the collective results. Accordingly, the proposed study protocol hopes to extend the current knowledge in this area by specifically examining the feasibility, tolerability, efficacy and safety of consuming twice daily protein supplements in the context of a multicomponent exercise program.</p><p id="Par56">Recruiting and retaining frail older adults into community-based intervention programs is a major issue that prior research has identified and is generally the reason why many studies report relatively small numbers of participants (and especially small numbers of completers) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Accordingly, this study has been designed to represent and test the efficacy of a pragmatic, community-led, exercise and nutrition program which is based on postulated hypotheses that remain to be debated within the fields of nutrition and gerontology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Addressing many of the methodological limitations noted in the background literature, this study protocol should optimise the ability to recruit pre-frail and frail older participants who want to remain independent and engaged within their communities. For example, participants will be diagnosed as being pre-frail or frail using the FRAIL Screen which can be easily used in all primary care settings because it is simple and quick; as such, a variety of recruitment channels will target to promote the study including general practice clinics, age-care organisations, groups that are dedicated to supporting older adults and also the general public via social media channels. Secondly, on a weekly basis throughout the 6-month intervention, our multi-disciplinary research team consisting of geriatricians, age-care nurses, exercise physiologists and dietitians/nutritionists will be supporting each participant&#x02014;albeit in a group setting&#x02014;to build a study community that should assist with maintaining participant motivation. Thirdly, the personalised tailoring of the exercise program should also maximise the likelihood that each participant will progressively improve their strength, flexibility, balance and endurance, and thereby improve their physical health and overall wellbeing.</p><p id="Par57">Regarding the protein supplementation part of the program, participants will be instructed to consume the daily protein supplements in close proximity (i.e. &#x0003c;1&#x000a0;h) to the completion of the exercise and in between meals on non-exercise days. The timing of consumption was based on the ongoing theory that resistance training increases amino acid delivery to the muscles, as well as absorption; hence, participants should be consuming an adequate amount of substrate, in a timeframe, that should maximise stimulation of muscle protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Moreover, there is consistent evidence that whey protein rather than casein, milk, soy or pea is more superior at promoting muscle protein synthesis or building muscle mass due to its higher quality (i.e. higher free amino acid to total amino acid content and especially its high essential branched-chain and leucine content) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. However, other plant-based proteins such as rice or pea protein are popular with consumers and while they are of lower protein quality, evidence regarding their impact on muscle mass, strength or physical performance/function, particularly when consumed over several months, remains scant. Therefore, this study will directly compare a whey protein supplement (i.e. higher quality protein) to a rice protein supplement (i.e. a lower quality protein) to address this concern. Long-term tolerability and safety to both proteins, as well as to the exercise program, will also be an important issue addressed within this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par58">This study is expected to provide much needed insight into the feasibility of recruiting and retaining frail older adults into community-based intervention programs, while providing knowledge relating to the safety, tolerability and benefits of a combined exercise and protein supplement program designed to halt or reverse the transition of physical frailty in the community. If shown to be effective, this strategy could be used to inform the design of cost-effectiveness trials which will be necessary if public health policy makers and funders are to be strategically influenced. Evaluation of the collective findings from current and future research will be critical to refine and extend the current best practice clinical guidelines for community-dwelling older people who are pre-frail or frail.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p id="Par5">Adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BIA</term><def><p id="Par6">Bioelectrical impedance analyses</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CT</term><def><p id="Par7">Computer tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GDS-5</term><def><p id="Par8">Geriatric Depression Screen-5</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GFR</term><def><p id="Par9">Glomerular filtration rates</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KATZ ADL</term><def><p id="Par10">Katz Activities of Daily Living</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Lawton iADL</term><def><p id="Par11">Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MNA-SF</term><def><p id="Par12">Self Mini Nutritional Assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCS</term><def><p id="Par13">Rapid Cognitive Screen</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RPE</term><def><p id="Par14">Rating of perceived exertion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF-36</term><def><p id="Par15">Short Form Health Survey-36</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPPB</term><def><p id="Par16">Short Physical Performance Battery</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TUG</term><def><p id="Par17">Timed Up and Go Test</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Ms Kylie Lange for the statistical advice, calculating the sample size and setting up the randomisation for this study.
