All patients received 12&#x02013;16 sessions of MICBT on an outpatient basis.

About more than a half of patients with OCD respond to CBT.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] All CBT programs essentially involve exposure and response prevention (ERP) and/or belief modification-based ERP.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] However, using traditional CBT strategies in treating patients with predominant obsessions (POs) without overt compulsions is fraught with problems because mental compulsions are not easily amenable for intervention.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Pure obsessions have been defined as &#x0201c;obsessional thoughts, images, or impulses that are not accompanied by motor compulsions or very few, if any, but can be associated with cognitive compulsions or other forms of neutralization.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] A variety of cognitive neutralization strategies (i.e., thought stopping, rationalization, distraction, thought replacement, self-punishment, mental list making, substituting neutral images, mentally rehearsing a particular sequence of numbers, staring at an object or forming its exact mental representation, ritualistic prayer, mental review of conversations/sequence of events, mentally checking and patterning objects, etc.) are utilized by patients with OCD.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Mental compulsions have been impending in the way of successful treatment through ERP.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In addition, there is limited literature on the treatment of POs.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Several strategies have been employed to treat obsessions, one of them being mindfulness-based approach.

In addition, preliminary research suggests that mindfulness may be an effective component of a holistic intervention for patients with POs if integrated with other empirically supported treatments.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Hence, this open-label study examines the effect of integration of mindfulness training with CBT in the treatment of POs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The aim of the present study was to examine the efficacy of mindfulness-integrated CBT (MICBT) in reducing symptom severity and in improving socio-occupational functioning and quality of life in patients with PO without prominent overt compulsions.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Participants and procedure</title><p>Forty-nine English/Hindi-speaking patients (with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition [DSM-IV] Text Revision diagnosis of OCD) with POs attending the OCD clinic and the Behavioral Medicine Unit of the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India, between July 2010 and September 2011 were approached for participation in the study. Out of this, 11 patients did not fulfill the specified inclusion/exclusion criteria of the study and eight patients did not give consent for various reasons. Of the thirty patients who agreed to participate in the study, three dropped out after the baseline assessment and psycho-education sessions. Of the remaining 27 patients, one patient completed ten sessions but was not available for postassessment and 3-month follow-up assessment and another patient's follow-up could not be completed due to migration abroad.</p><p>Patients were assessed at baseline, mid- and post-treatment, and at 3-month follow-up on measures of obsessive-compulsive severity, insight, global severity of illness, depression, anxiety, socio-occupational functioning, and quality of life. An independent trained rater (psychiatrist) administered the primary outcome measures, the 10-item severity measure of the Yale&#x02013;Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS),[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] at baseline, mid- and post-treatment, and at 3-month follow-up. All the other assessments (described under measures) were performed by the first author. The diagnoses and comorbid conditions were confirmed by one of the consultant psychiatrists of the OCD clinic.</p><p>Inclusion criteria included adult patients with a primary diagnosis of DSM-IV OCD[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] with few or no overt compulsions and free of medication or on a stable medication regimen for at least 2 months prior to baseline assessment. Exclusion criteria included presence of prominent motor compulsions (motor compulsions which consume more than 1 h/day [YBOCS item 6, score &#x0003e;1], cause more than mild interference in functioning [YBOCS item 7, score &#x0003e;1], causing more than mild distress [YBOCS item 8, score &#x0003e;1]), and a history of having received CBT in the previous year. None of the patients suffered from comorbid psychosis, bipolar disorder, and alcohol/substance abuse or dependence.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Measures</title><p>A diagnosis of OCD was confirmed by administering the MINI International Neuropsychiatry Interview.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Personality disorders were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis-II Personality Disorders.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Symptom profile and severity of OCD was determined using the YBOCS. The CGI scale measured the overall severity of illness (severity subscale, the CGI severity [CGI-S]) and the improvement (improvement subscale, the CGI-I). The Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), a 10-item clinician-administered scale, measured severity of depression,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory consisting of 2 forms, namely X1 (i.e., state anxiety) and X2 (i.e., trait anxiety) each comprising twenty items measured anxiety.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>The disability and the quality of life were measured using the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF).[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] The SDS, a 10-item visual analog scale, assesses functional impairment in three interrelated domains: Work/school, social, and family life.

Participants first completed a meditation exercise and then rated the extent to which they were aware and accepting of their inner experiences during the exercise.</p><p>The Homework Compliance Scale, administered postintervention, is a 2-item scale used to assess the homework compliance in CBT programs.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] The two items are degree of homework compliance and quality of homework compliance. Degree of homework compliance is rated on a 6-point scale (1 = patient did not attempt assigned homework to 6 = patient did more of the assigned homework than was requested) and quality of homework compliance is also rated on a 6-point scale (1 = patient just recorded thought diary and rating of anxiety to 6 = patient was able to dispute irrational beliefs in a logical manner). Higher scores indicate greater homework compliance. Inter-rater reliability for degree and quality of homework compliance was found to be good in a previous study from this center (<italic>r</italic> = 0.83 and <italic>r</italic> = 0.91, respectively).[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Treatment</title><p>A qualified clinical psychologist (A. K.) under the supervision of an experienced mindfulness practitioner and cognitive behavioral therapist (M.P.S.) provided MICBT. Psychotherapy was supervised on a fortnightly basis and each patient received 12&#x02013;16 sessions of 90 min duration each, delivered twice a week over a period of 1.5&#x02013;2 months. Training in sitting mindfulness was integrated in the intervention program from the first contact onward and introduced to all patients for approximately 40 min at the end of each therapeutic session and advised to practice it every day as a homework assignment. Initial 4&#x02013;6 sessions were devoted to detailed information about mindfulness perspective of cognitive intrusions and its application in various situations. Subsequent sessions focused on cognitive restructuring of obsessive beliefs, cognitive appraisals, and negative automatic thoughts.</p><p>Psycho-education began with the aim of developing understanding about obsessive-compulsive phenomenon from cognitive, behavioral, and mindfulness perspectives with special emphasis on &#x0201c;what works&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;what does not work&#x0201d; in handling obsessions. Each patient was educated about the following aspects of obsessions: (a) Most people get unwanted thoughts,[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] (b) occurrence of thoughts is not necessarily under one's control, but the way one responds or relates to them can be modified, (c) obsessions can be understood as false brain messages,[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] (d) obsessions do not reflect reality or the intention of the individual, (e) thought suppression is ineffective in controlling obsessions,[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and (e) compulsions and neutralizing strategies contribute to the maintenance of obsessions.</p><p>Patients were also helped to understand that (a) experience of distress caused by the obsessions is an essential part of MICBT, (b) compulsions are &#x0201c;self-discovered remedies&#x0201d; to reduce the distress but they &#x0201c;do not work&#x0201d; and rather result in more obsessive-compulsive behavior or distress, and (c) experiential avoidance maintain obsessive-compulsive phenomenon.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>The following techniques were employed to help patient develop mindfulness perspective toward obsessions:[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] (a) Be in the state of mindfulness about sensations, thoughts, and feelings, (b) pay attention and bring nonjudgmental awareness to immediate experience of thoughts, sensations, and feelings, (c) emphasis on developing an accepting, noninvolving, and nonelaborative attitude (i.e., &#x0201c;let go&#x0201d;) toward thoughts, sensations, and emotional states, for example, by using specific phrases (e.g., &#x0201c;thoughts are just mental events, not facts,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;thoughts and distress are impermanent mental events&#x0201d;) and metaphors (e.g., &#x0201c;consider thoughts such as passing clouds in the sky&#x0201d;), (d) and encourage and help the patient in preventing any overt or covert neutralization or compulsion. These techniques were taught in the session by asking patient on a regular basis what he/she was thinking or doing that particular moment to deal with distress or obsessions. To ensure mindfulness state, various prompt questions were utilized (e.g., Are you able to become aware of these thoughts? Are you able to realize that these are false messages? Do they reflect your intention? Do they reflect reality? Is it wise to believe in messages delivered by thoughts? Is there any need to give importance to this thought? Are you aware that these thoughts are befooling you?).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software for Windows, version 15 (Chicago, Illinois: SPSS Inc. 2006). Continuous variables were tested for normal distribution by utilizing Shapiro&#x02013;Wilk test. All continuous variables were normally distributed. Intent-to-treat analysis was employed for 27 patients, where two missing data were imputed by the last observation carried forward method. Repeated-measures analysis of variance with measures of effect size (partial eta squared) was computed for continuous variables with time as repeated measure and presence of any axis-I comorbid disorder, age of onset, and number of adequate SRIs trials as covariates. Logistic regression analysis (Backward Wald) was used to identify the predictors of remission. Remission was defined as at least 55% reduction in the YBOCS severity total score after completing an adequate trial of MICBT.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] All tests were two-tailed, and statistical significance level was set at 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the sample are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

With MICBT, there was a significant reduction in the severity of obsessions, global severity of illness, and in the severity of anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Eighteen (67%) participants achieved remission. There was no worsening of obsessive symptoms from postassessment to 3-month follow-up after discontinuation of intervention. A significant reduction in the severity of obsessions at postintervention is consistent with the published literature on the efficacy of CBT in pure obsessions.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Reduction in the severity of obsessions may be attributed to the practice of sitting mindfulness meditation, mindfully handling obsessions, and/or cognitive restructuring of obsessive beliefs and appraisals.</p><p>The mean posttreatment YBOCS total score for treatment completers (mean = 4.92; SD = 2.54) in the present study is substantially lower than in other studies. Freeston and Ladouceur reported a posttreatment mean YBOCS total score of 7.2 (SD = 5.2) for treatment completers and 9.8 (SD = 8.2) for the total sample.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] O'Connor <italic>et al</italic>. reported a posttreatment mean YBOCS total score of 8.0 (SD = 2.8) for 17 participants who completed individual treatment.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] As neither of these two treatment studies reported separate scores for obsessions and compulsions, a comparison of subscales is not possible. However, Whittal <italic>et al</italic>. reported separate scores for obsessions (posttreatment mean = 4.62; SD = 2.88) and total YBOCS severity (posttreatment mean = 6.43; SD = 4.77) for treatment completers in their randomized controlled trial.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In the present study, postintervention obsession severity is very similar to that reported by Whittal <italic>et al</italic>. in their study.</p><p>Those with POs were considered difficult to treat with the conventional CBT as compulsions and other neutralizing behaviors are not observable or accessible and difficult to prevent during exposure.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] In the present study, mindfulness was integrated with traditional CBT to handle obsessions and neutralizations. Mindfulness might have facilitated habituation by creating understanding in patients that intrusive thoughts are benign and do not reflect reality. Hanstede <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that mindfulness intervention reduces OCD symptoms by increasing &#x0201c;let go&#x0201d; attitude in the patients.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] In addition, Abbas and Hossein have shown &#x0201c;detached mindfulness&#x0201d; as an effective component of mindfulness meditation to improve obsessive-compulsive symptoms.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] Therapeutic program of the present study emphasized on just observing intrusive thoughts nonjudgmentally without interference or elaboration and cultivating &#x0201c;let go&#x0201d; attitude. In our study, score on TMS increased along with reduction in scores on YBOCS obsessions.</p><p>MICBT had a significant treatment effect on state and trait anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Reduction in state and trait anxiety is in accordance with the findings of other interventional studies in OCD.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] There was a significant reduction in the severity of depression too, which is consistent with the earlier efficacy studies of CBT on pure obsessions.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Mindfulness training has been found to be effective in improving depression.[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] Our findings suggest that integration of mindfulness may have a significant treatment effect on co-existing depression and anxiety in patients with POs. There was a significant treatment effect on family and socio-occupational functioning and quality of life [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. These findings are also consistent with the previous studies involving CBT in OCD.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</p><p>An open-label design and lack of a control group limit the degree to which symptom improvement can be attributed to direct effect of the therapeutic program rather than nonspecific effect of treatment. Although mindfulness was an important component of the program, outcome cannot be attributed to &#x0201c;mindfulness&#x0201d; alone since other active components were part of the therapeutic program. In our study, we could not identify any predictor of remission, possibly because of small sample size. In addition, the variables associated with therapeutic process such as therapeutic alliance, treatment motivation, treatment expectancy, and treatment integrity were also not assessed and therefore could not be utilized for analysis of predictors of treatment outcome. The present study's 3-month follow-up period may not be sufficient to assess the long-term maintenance of treatment gains.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Earlier, obsessions were considered difficult to treat; however, the present study findings indicate that significant clinical improvement is possible with MICBT in treating obsessions. Addition of MICBT to patients already receiving SRIs led to a significant reduction in OCD symptoms in most patients. Thus, adding MICBT may help many patients for whom SRI treatment alone is not enough. The results of the present study are encouraging and suggest that a larger randomized controlled trial examining the effects of MICBT may now be warranted.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>&#x000d6;st</surname><given-names>LG</given-names></name><name><surname>Havnen</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Hansen</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Kvale</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cognitive behavioral treatments of obsessive-compulsive disorder.
