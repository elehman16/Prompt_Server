electromyography (EMG) measurements of trunk muscle activity in individuals with and
without limited hip flexion range of motion (ROM) during visual display terminal (VDT)
work with cross-legged sitting. [Subjects] The 15 participants included a control group
with sufficient hip flexion ROM (n = 7) and an experimental group with limited hip flexion
ROM (n = 8). [Methods] All subjects performed VDT work with cross-legged sitting. The
lumbar flexion angle was measured using a three-dimensional motion capture system, and the
trunk muscle activity was recorded using a surface EMG system during VDT work with
cross-legged sitting. The differences in trunk flexion angle and trunk muscle activity
between the two groups were analyzed using independent t-tests. [Results] The lumbar
flexion angle was significantly greater in the experimental group than the control group,
although trunk muscle activity did not differ between the two groups. [Conclusion] These
findings suggest that limited hip flexion leads to greater lumbar flexion during
cross-legged sitting.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Cross-legged sitting</kwd><kwd>Electromyography</kwd><kwd>Lumbar flexion</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Desktop computer and laptop use is becoming common, and computing-related musculoskeletal
symptoms are considered important health problems in university students and office
workers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies have indicated that improper sitting posture
during visual display terminal (VDT) work (e.g., desktop computer or laptop use) can induce
musculoskeletal disorders, especially low-back pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). Carter and Banister<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>
suggested that increased tension in ligaments and discs during a slumped sitting posture may
lead to low-back pain.</p><p>Cross-legged sitting, a commonly adopted posture during daily living and VDT work, has been
reported to induce a slumped sitting posture<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lee et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that the cross-legged sitting
position leads to a greater slumped posture compared with an upright sitting posture during
VDT work. To prevent the unwanted slumped posture, it is crucial to identify factors that
contribute to slumped posture during cross-legged sitting. Limited hip flexion range of
motion (ROM) could be one possible risk factor for excessive lumbar flexion. Because the
lumbar spine and hip joint are connected via the pelvis, limited hip flexion can cause
greater lumbar flexion through pelvic posterior tilt during the trunk flexion-related
posture<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although it seems reasonable that limited hip flexion ROM leads to greater lumbar flexion
during the cross-legged sitting posture, no study has investigated how hip flexion ROM
influences the kinematics of the lumbar spine in the cross-legged posture during VDT work.
Furthermore, previous studies have not determined whether greater lumbar flexion during VDT
work with a cross-legged sitting posture changes trunk muscle activities as measured by
electromyography (EMG). Only one EMG study revealed decreased EMG activity in the internal
oblique (IO) muscles during the static cross-legged sitting posture compared with the static
normal sitting posture<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, the aim of
the present study was to compare the lumbar flexion angle and trunk muscle activity in
individuals with and without limited hip flexion ROM during VDT work with a cross-legged
sitting position.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>In total, 15 university students were recruited for this study. All subjects showed
right-leg dominance and performed computer work more than 20 hours per week. Measurements of
the right hip flexion ROM were used to classify subjects into the experimental or control
groups. According to previous findings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>,
sufficient hip flexion ROM was defined as more than 120&#x000b0; of hip flexion, and limited hip
flexion ROM was defined as &#x02264;110&#x000b0; in this study. Subjects with more than 120&#x000b0; of right hip
flexion ROM (one female, six males) were classified into the control group, and subjects
with no more than 110&#x000b0; of right hip flexion ROM (eight males) were classified into the
experimental group. Subjects were excluded if they had acute low-back pain, orthopedic
damage, or lower extremity injury during the last 6 months. In addition, individuals with
hip flexion ROM between 110&#x000b0; and 120&#x000b0; were also excluded in this study. The Inje University
Faculty of Health Science Human Ethics Committee approved this study, and each subject
signed an informed consent form before participation.</p><p>To measure hip flexion ROM, subjects were placed in the supine position on a table, and an
examiner passively flexed the right hip of subjects until further hip flexion was limited by
firm end feel<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The fulcrum of a
goniometer was placed on the greater trochanter, and the proximal and distal arms were
aligned with the lateral midlines of the pelvis and femur, respectively.</p><p>The lumbar flexion angle was measured using eight VICON MX-T10 motion capture systems
(Vicon Motion Systems Ltd., Oxford, UK) with a 100-Hz sampling rate. Three reflective
markers were placed on the bilateral anterior superior iliac spines and on the midpoint
between the bilateral posterior superior iliac spines for the pelvic segment. Additionally,
four reflective markers were attached to the first and second lumbar spinous processes and
3&#x02005;cm bilaterally from the second lumbar spinous process for the lumbar segment. The lumbar
flexion angle was calculated by assessing the anterior rotation of the lumbar segment with
respect to the pelvic segment using the Cardan angle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The trunk muscle activity of the bilateral rectus abdominis (RA),
external oblique (EO), and IO muscles was recorded using a synchronized surface EMG system
(Delsys Inc., Boston, MA, USA). Prior to attachment of the electrodes, skin preparation was
performed by shaving the hair and cleansing with an alcohol swab. Each electrode was
attached along the direction of the muscle fiber based on placements suggested by
Criswell<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. EMG signals were acquired
at a sampling rate of 1,000&#x02005;Hz with a bandwidth of 20&#x02013;450&#x02005;Hz and converted into
root-mean-square (RMS) data. To normalize EMG data of the trunk muscles, reference voluntary
contraction (RVC) data of trunk muscles were collected when subjects were seated on a chair
in a comfortable sitting posture with 90&#x000b0; of hip and knee flexion for 40 s. The RVC maneuver
was repeated three times, and the mean value of the average muscle activity for the middle
30&#x02005;s of the three trials was used to normalize trunk muscle activity.</p><p>Prior to VDT work, a laptop (XNOTE R400, LG, Seoul, Korea) was placed on a 73-cm-high desk,
and subjects sat on a height-adjustable chair without a backrest with 90&#x000b0; of hip and knee
flexion. The examiner confirmed the 90&#x000b0; hip and knee flexion position using a goniometer.
For VDT work with a cross-legged sitting posture, subjects were instructed to cross the
right leg over the left by putting the right knee on the left knee<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Following
cross-legged sitting, subjected performed typing work in which they copied some text
provided on the monitor by the Korean version of Hansoft. The subjects typed for 1&#x02005;min for
each trial, and three test trials were conducted with 30-s rest periods between trials. The
average values of the lumbar flexion angle and EMG activity of the trunk muscles for the
middle 40&#x02005;s of each trial were collected, and the mean values of three test trials were used
for data analysis.</p><p>The subjects&#x02019; characteristics (age, height, weight, hip flexion ROM), lumbar flexion angle

Ver. 18.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used, and the statistical significance level

flexion compared with subjects with sufficient hip flexion ROM during VDT work with
cross-legged sitting; however, these differences in hip flexion ROM did not influence EMG
activity in trunk muscles.</p><p>The lumbo-pelvic-hip complex is connected via a kinematic link termed the lumbo-pelvic
rhythm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. During forward bending, the lumbar spine is flexed anteriorly with
respect to the pelvis, while the pelvis is flexed anteriorly on the femur<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. When lumbar flexion is limited, greater
hip flexion is required with pelvic anterior tilt throughout the lumbo-pelvic rhythm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In other words, greater lumbar flexion is
caused throughout the pelvic posterior tilt when hip flexion is limited. The results of our
study imply that greater lumbar flexion compensated for insufficient hip flexion in subjects
in the experimental group during VDT work with cross-legged sitting.</p><p>Despite significant differences in lumbar flexion between the experimental and control
groups, EMG activity in the trunk muscles was not significantly different between the two
groups. Snijders et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that the cross-legged sitting position decreased EMG activity in IO muscles due to
increased stability in the sacroiliac joint. The cross-legged sitting posture is performed
by the combined motion of hip flexion and adduction. Increased tension in the biceps
femoris, gluteus maximus and piriformis by hip flexion and abduction influences sacroiliac
joint compression and tension in the sacrotuberous ligament, which can contribute to
increased stability in the sacroiliac joint<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Although the hip flexion angle may have been influenced by differences in hip flexion ROM in
subjects in this study, sufficient hip adduction may have been possible for all subjects
during VDT work with cross-legged sitting. We suggest that the sacroiliac joint compression
by hip adduction during cross-legged sitting may not differ between subjects with and
without limited hip flexion ROM, resulting in the absence of significant differences in EMG
activity in trunk muscles between the two groups.</p><p>There are some limitations to our study. First, our study included a small sample size;
therefore, it is difficult to generalize our results. Second, the subjects performed VDT
work for only 1&#x02005;min. However, a previous study by Lee et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that trunk kinematics were immediately changed after assuming
a cross-legged sitting posture during VDT work, and the trunk flexion angle then did not
significantly change for 30&#x02005;min. Based on previous findings, we consider that the kinematic
data of the lumbar spine and EMG data of the trunk muscles during VDT work with cross-legged
sitting for short periods may provide meaningful information for individuals who prefer
cross-legged sitting.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by a 2013 Inje University research grant.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>CH</given-names></name><name><surname>Amick</surname><given-names>BC</given-names><suffix>3rd</suffix></name><name><surname>Menendez</surname><given-names>CC</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Daily computer usage correlated with undergraduate
