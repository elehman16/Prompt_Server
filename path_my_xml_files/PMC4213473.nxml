However, some studies indicate that over- and under-treatment with anticoagulants are fairly common.

Eligible patients were classified into 3 categories (1: patients with a long-term indication for OAC and taking anticoagulants, 2: patients with a long-term indication for OAC but not taking anticoagulants, 3: patients without a long-term indication for OAC but taking an anticoagulant on a permanent basis).

In German family practices, the most common indications for long-term OAC therapy are atrial fibrillation/flutter, recurrent venous and/or pulmonary thromboembolisms, and mechanical heart prostheses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, some studies indicate that over- and under-treatment with anticoagulants are fairly common. According to the Registry of the German Competence NETwork on Atrial Fibrillation (AFNET), which includes over 9,000 patients, 72% of eligible patients received anticoagulation treatment, while 17% were only given antiplatelet drugs, and as many as 11% of patients indicated for anticoagulation received no therapy whatsoever [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A survey by the West Birmingham Atrial Fibrillation Project indicated that of 71 patients who were not treated with warfarin, only 17% had any recorded contraindications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A study in 16 German family practices showed that there is room for improvement in monitoring, documentation quality and patient participation in anticoagulant treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. OAC self-management, in which patients self-monitor their INR (International Normalized Ratio) values and self-adjust their medication dosages, is a possible option to increase the involvement of patients in their antithrombotic treatment. Studies confirm that thromboembolic events occur less frequently in patients performing self-management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and this is also true of elderly patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>However, little is known about the quality of routine anticoagulation therapy in German family practices. Since March 2012, the Institute of General Practice, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Germany, has therefore been conducting the cluster randomized controlled PICANT trial (Primary Care Management for Optimized Antithrombotic Treatment), primarily in family practices in the state of Hesse, Germany, on patients with a long-term indication for OAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The aim of the PICANT study is to find out whether a best practice model that includes major elements of case management and patient education, such as self-management, can improve antithrombotic management in primary health care in terms of reducing major thromboembolic and bleeding events over a follow up period of 2&#x000a0;years.</p><p>The aim of this paper is to assess treatment with anticoagulants in German family practices on the basis of the screening results of the PICANT trial by determining to what extent over- and under-treatment exist, finding out how many screened patients have INR values within their therapeutic target ranges, and by describing the distinguishing characteristics of screened patients with a long-term indication for OAC.

In brief, we identified potentially eligible practices from a list provided by the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (mandatory registration). Practices were stratified according to the number of inhabitants in the postal area in which the practice was located. The address database was broken down into groups according to the physician&#x02019;s specialization (general practitioner (GP), specialist in internal medicine, or medical practitioner). As the registration list only contains the names and addresses of family doctors, we mailed information on the trial to 568 randomly selected practices (6% of all registered practices in 2012) and invited them to participate. Inclusion criteria were only checked for those who were interested in participation. The appropriate sample size was calculated and practice recruitment stopped when 52 practices had enrolled, even though further practices were interested in participating.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patient recruitment</title><p>Each participating practice was visited after practice recruitment, but before cluster randomization, and asked to use the practice software to generate a screening list of potentially eligible patients on the basis of predefined instructions and search terms provided by the study team members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The GPs then checked the lists and deleted eventual cases of patients that had only been seen occasionally or had died in the meantime. Inclusion criteria were then assessed by the GP and study team for 30 randomly selected patients from the list. A documentation sheet was filled in for each screened patient. To avoid a selection bias, the order of the patients assessed for eligibility was chosen by means of the random number generator function in Microsoft Excel&#x000ae;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data collection</title><p>The GP provided the following data for the screened patients: age, sex, long-term indication for OAC, antithrombotic medication, reasons for exclusion, most recent INR value and date of assessment in the family practice, and migration background. The GP was also asked to allocate each patient&#x02019;s level of compliance to one of three categories (very good compliance, good compliance, non-compliant). The study team determined the INR target range for each individual patient according to current guideline recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. On the basis of the data provided by the GP, the study team classified each screened patient in one of three categories (1: patients with a long-term indication for OAC and taking anticoagulants, 2: patients with a long-term indication for OAC but not taking anticoagulants, 3: patients without a long-term indication for OAC but taking an anticoagulant on a permanent basis). Category 1 represents patients receiving appropriate OAC therapy, category 2 patients that are under-treated, and category 3 patients that are over-treated.</p><p>In agreement with study protocol, only patients from categories 1 and 2 were eligible for study participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The 30 identified patients from each practice were then sent a letter of invitation to participate in the trial, and patient recruitment discontinued when 15 patients per practice had agreed in writing to participate. After successful patient recruitment, the family practices were randomly allocated to the best practice model (intervention group) or routine care (control group) in a ratio of 1:1, using the web-based randomization service Randomizer for Clinical Trials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomizer.at/">www.randomizer.at</ext-link>).

Patients on new antithrombotic medications were rare when the study began, and self-management of OAC was performed by fewer than 10% of patients.</p><p>Our findings are consistent with those of a study by Nilsson et al. that aimed to assess warfarin treatment in Swedish primary health care centres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Patient characteristics such as age, sex, and the primary indications for treatment (firstly atrial fibrillation and secondly deep venous thrombosis) were comparable. However, in contrast to Nilsson et al. we also included patients taking antiplatelet drugs and NOACs which had not been approved in early-2000 when Nilsson&#x02019;s study was conducted. As part of PICANT, we will follow up on our patients over a period of 2&#x000a0;years and expect to see a shift from the old to the new drugs. In Germany, the numbers of prescriptions for the NOACs dabigatran and rivaroxaban increased sharply in 2012, rising almost 400% in the case of dabigatran and more than 1,000% for rivaroxaban [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, further research into the use of NOACs under practice conditions is needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The reasons why GPs are encouraging patients to switch to the new antithrombotic drugs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) will be examined at the end of the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to several other studies, the number of patients receiving appropriate OAC therapy was high. As mentioned in the introduction, under- and over-treatment were found to be extremely common in the AFNET trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and the West Birmingham Atrial Fibrillation Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, a systematic review by Ogilvie et al. discovered that patients with atrial fibrillation and a high risk of stroke were under-treated with oral anticoagulants in the majority of identified studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In our study only about 4.4% of patients were under-treated, and most of those had atrial fibrillation with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>VASc-Score &#x0003e;1. The percentage who were over-treated and had no further indication for OACs was also low (2.4%). We suspect that one of the main reasons for over- and under-treatment among patients is that some patients do not regularly attend the practice and that necessary changes to their treatment are simply overseen, either due to higher risk (possibly as a result of increasing age, or new co-morbidities), or because the initial indication has expired. A current UK study on the use of anticoagulants in family practices found that one third of patients with atrial fibrillation who were indicated for oral anticoagulation do not receive any such therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, it should be borne in mind that good reasons sometimes exist not to treat patients with oral anticoagulants (e.g. contraindications, bleeding complications, or a high risk of falls, especially in elderly patients). Over 67% of the patients we screened had INR values (based on only one measurement) within their therapeutic INR target ranges, which is consistent with a systematic review written by Wan et al. that presents results from 6 randomized controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Our INR screening results compare favourably with a German study conducted in 2007, which reported that only about 55% of patients with atrial fibrillation had INR values within their recommended target ranges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Only about 8% of all screened patients with a long-term indication for OAC actually performed OAC self-management. As early as 2009, about 150,000 patients in Germany were self-monitoring their INR-values and self-adjusting their dosages accordingly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. On the assumption that about 1 million patients in Germany take coumarins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the proportion of patients performing self-management in our study is lower than in the German population as a whole. Self-management helps prevent thromboembolic complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], indicating that strategies aimed at increasing patient involvement may enhance chronic illness care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Self-monitoring is also one important attribute of the intervention group in the PICANT trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], for which final results will be presented after study completion in March 2015.</p><p>This paper only presents one cross-sectional investigation in German family practices without any stratification of the German population as a whole. Nevertheless, we believe our sample is representative, as we randomly selected GPs and their patients in accordance with good clinical practice guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Dementia was the main reason for exclusion from our study, as expressed in a patient&#x02019;s inability to provide informed consent. That may have led to some bias, but dementia alone is no reason to deny a patient anticoagulation therapy and these patients were still included in the screening results presented in this manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The screening results show that most participants in the PICANT trial are receiving appropriate OAC therapy, and only a minority of patients taking oral anticoagulants are over- or under-treated. The proportion of inappropriately treated patients in our study is also much lower than reported in comparable studies, despite similar patient characteristics. From the onset of the study, the quality of anticoagulation therapies was high, and since the new oral anticoagulants have only recently been approved, most patients were still on coumarins.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>AFNET</term><def><p>The central registry of the German competence NETwork on atrial fibrillation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p>General practitioner</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>INR</term><def><p>International normalized ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NOACs</term><def><p>New oral anticoagulants</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OAC</term><def><p>Oral anticoagulation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PICANT</term><def><p>Primary care management for optimized antithrombotic treatment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>Standard deviation</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
