The findings suggest that a midwifery oral health service should be initiated and training, time constraints, and referral pathways must be addressed.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Wilson <italic>et al</italic>. reported that, despite having access to dental care, most pregnant women have a poor understanding of the potential oral health for both themselves and their children.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Based on mentioned points, the necessity of increasing the knowledge and practice of pregnant women in the prevention of oral diseases is deeply felt. Researches in developed countries have shown that 80% of the oral diseases are preventable via education.</p><p>Considering the importance of education in improving the health behavior of pregnant women, it is expected that healthcare workers acquired sufficient knowledge and skills in prevention of oral disease[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] to maintain oral health of people, particularly of vulnerable groups.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Hence, undoubtedly one of the strategies that could be used is oral health education, and its effectiveness depends on the proper use of the appropriate theory and models. The theory of planned behavior was introduced in 1885 and was developed in 1995 by Ajzen and Fishbin.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] This theory consists of constructions and states that the main cause of a behavior is intention. Intention is also influenced by attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, and the sum of the mentioned factors determines the performance. As a general rule, the more favorable the attitude and subjective norm, and the greater the perceived control, the stronger should be the person's intention to perform the behavior in question.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>This theory is among the few theories that pay attention to social factors in the creation of a specific behavior. This theory can be used in the field of oral health education in pregnancy.</p><p>Considering the lack of knowledge of pregnant women regarding the importance of oral health, the aim of the present study was to assess the effect of education on the promotion of oral health in pregnant women based on the planned behavior theory among women attending maternal health centers of Birjand.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This quasi-experimental study was carried out among 150 pregnant women who were selected using the random sampling method among women referred to the health centers of Birjand in 2016 (75 women each in the test and control group).</p><p>Informed consent was obtained from each participant. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Birjand University of Medical Sciences and the health centers of Birjand city in 2016. The studied samples were selected from two health centers with socioeconomic and cultural similarities. Based on the following formula:</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="JISPCD-6-584-g001.jpg"/></p><p>with a confidence interval of 95% and power of 80%, and based on the previous study, the number of samples was calculated to be 68 for each group.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Anticipating some dropout cases, the sample size was calculated to be 75 in each group. The study was carried out in a period of 3 months. Inclusion criteria were consent of women to participate in the study, gestational age of less than 24 weeks, the ability to read and write, not affecting advanced oral disease, and not employed in professions related to dentistry. Exclusion criteria were absence from the educational program, lack of an interest to fill the questionnaire or incomplete response to the questionnaires. Data collection tools was a standard questionnaire whose validity and reliability was confirmed in a study by Ebrahimipour and Mohamadzadeh.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The questionnaire included demographic data (10 questions) and questions related to knowledge (12 questions), attitude (7 questions), subjective norms (4 questions), perceived behavioral control (5 questions), intention (5 questions), and performance (7 questions). Each participant completed the questionnaires on two separate occasions (pre-intervention and 2 months after intervention) to evaluate the effectiveness of the educational interventional program. During a 2-month period, pregnant women in the case group received educational intervention sessions based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Educational materials included lectures, slides, posters, videos, and hands-on training of oral health with full mouth model with large tooth brush and dental floss. Training sessions were conducted by an oral and dental health staff employed in the Health Centre. The control group received only usual training through leaflet distribution. Two months after the training sessions, data were collected again. This interval time was enough to assess oral health behavior in women. Statistical package for social sciences version 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used to analyze the data using chi-square test, independent <italic>t</italic>-test, and paired <italic>t</italic>-test and their nonparametric equivalents at 0.05% of significance level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Study results showed that both the case and control groups in terms of demographic variables (age, number of children, job, literacy level, and income) are comparable with no statistically significant differences (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).</p><p>Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test showed that the constructions of attitude, perceived behavioral control, and intention showed normal and the constructions of knowledge, subjective norms, and performance showed non-normal distribution.

Before the intervention, the mean grade scores of demographic characteristics and all variables (knowledge, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, intention, and performance) between the two groups were comparable and there were no significant differences (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). This confirms that the two groups were similar in terms of socioeconomic and cultural aspects.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Distribution of demographic variables in the case and control groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISPCD-6-584-g004"/></table-wrap><p>After intervention, the mean scores of knowledge, attitude, and subjective norms increased in the case group as a significant difference was observed compared to the pre-intervention and also compared to the control group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Our findings showed that the educational intervention based on the TPB improves all the components influencing the behaviors in pregnant women, so that enhancement of knowledge, change of attitude and perceived behavioral control, positive impact on subjective norms and behavioral intention ultimately resulted in the promotion of oral health behaviors of pregnant women. Alexandrina noted that knowledge, attitude, and perceived behavioral control with impact on behavioral intention promote oral health in first-year medical students. These findings could help both dentists and dental hygienists in oral health education to the patients and changing patients&#x02019; oral hygiene habits.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The TPB is based on the concept that, the stronger the intention to perform a given behavior, the greater the likelihood that the person will perform that behavior.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Similarly, the current study also showed that performance had the most correlation with intention (<italic>r</italic> = 0.491) and intention showed the most correlation with subjective norms (<italic>r</italic> = 0.374) followed by perceived behavioral control.</p><p>Ebrahimipour <italic>et al</italic>. showed that education of pregnant women based on TPB improved all the components influencing the oral health behaviors, except for subjective norms.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Researches showed that oral health education is effective in improving the knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding oral health and in reducing the plaque and bleeding on probing of the gingival and caries.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Brein <italic>et al</italic>. used the TPB to identify predictors of oral hygiene and noted that periodontal practitioners should consider the strong associations of attitude and perceived behavioral control with brushing and interdental cleaning behaviors when designing interventional efforts to improve patient home care.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>In a study by Viera <italic>et al</italic>., TPB was used to assess patients&#x02019; intentions and behavior to predict the willingness to undergo prosthodontics care. They concluded that perceived behavioral control was a relevant TPB component that encompasses perception of costs, opportunity cost, perceived need, and access to dental care.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Most participants of the current study had academic education that facilitated their learning process. Hence, education based on TPB could have more positive impact on all components that lead to behavioral changes.</p><p>One of the noteworthy points in this study was improvement in the results of the control group in the second stage of completion of the questionnaire. Although comparison of the two groups after intervention showed a significant difference in the case group rather than the control group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), it seems that the leaflet distribution acted as a confounding factor and promoted oral health behaviors.</p><p>In the case group, educational intervention was done as face-to-face training sessions, whereas in the control group, information was propagated as leaflet distribution, which ultimately leads to development of all constructions except the attitude. A study by Karimi <italic>et al</italic>. also showed that lectures has a positive effect on the knowledge and attitude while the pamphlet does not alter the attitude.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Therefore, face-to-face training along with change in the attitude further promote the health behaviors.</p><p>Education is the key element in the success of health care services, including oral health education, and the best approach is face-to-face education, which leads to learning stability and ultimately behavioral changes. Oral health education should be accessible and acceptable to the target group, and negative perceptions in the community must be modified through providing proper messages via holding educational classes in health clinics. Meanwhile, the use of training leaflet which is actually a lightweight and inexpensive media which can be used anytime and anywhere can be considered in case of impossibility to attend training sessions.</p><p>Among the study limitations were rush in carrying out the study and intervention due to pregnancy, difficulty in completing the questionnaire due to physiological conditions of women, and the use of self-report tools for data collection. It is suggested that oral hygiene instruction programs be included in the pre-pregnancy care schedule and periodic examinations be carried out to evaluate adherence and maintaining good oral hygiene among women.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This article is part of the student thesis approved by vice chancellery for research of Birjand University of Medical Sciences.
