Knee osteoarthritis mainly occurs in elders and middle age people and is more common among women and overweight subjects.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The condition's progress is slow and joints are rather involved bilaterally and symmetrically.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The symptoms include pain, stiffness and decreased range of motion (ROM), which result in limited activity and reduced quality of life.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The main goal of rehabilitation in such patients is reducing pain, restoring function, and improving patient's quality of life.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Treatment methods of knee osteoarthritis can be put in three main groups: Medicine, surgical, and non-medicinal.</p><p>Generally, non-steroid anti-inflammatory medicines are prescribed for osteoarthritis. In some cases, intra-articular injection of corticosteroids may be done too. These medicines have numerous harming side effects on cardiovascular, digestive system, and kidneys.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Methods used in surgical treatment include debridement and osteotomies, which are all temporary reliefs and only delay the condition's progress. Ultimately, with progression of the problem other surgical procedures such as joint arthrodesis or arthroplasty may be necessary. Joint arthrodesis is not popular as it totally diminishes joint's ROM. Knee arthroplasty is a widely accepted treatment is severe knee osteoarthritis. But surgical treatment is very stressful for the patient and the family and also it's expensive and time consuming process specially because the patients are mostly old and find it difficult to tolerate vast surgical procedures.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Thus non-surgical treatments, which do not have the side effects of the medicines, are popular among doctors and patients.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Non-medicinal treatments for knee osteoarthritis include physical therapy,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] acupuncture medicine, using assistive devices like crutch, knee brace, medical insoles and heel wedges,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] losing weight, and exercise.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In physical therapy of the involved knee, modalities like exercise therapy, patient instruction, mobilization, electrotherapy, which includes pain reducing stimulations like Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS), diathermy, ultrasound, etc., and warmth and cold are used.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>According to studies, exercise can help controling symptoms of osteoarthritis such as pain, lack of flexibility, decreased strength, and morning stiffness.

Results showed that both aerobic and resistive protocols increased physical function of the patients and both protocols had similar effects.</p><p>Ebnezar <italic>et al</italic>., (2012) studied the effects of yoga exercises on pain, morning stiffness, and anxiety of 250 patients with knee osteoarthritis. The control group only received physical therapy but the experimental group received physical therapy and yoga. Researchers concluded that doing yoga and physical therapy together has more positive effects than physical therapy alone. The results showed greater decrease in pain, morning stiffness, and anxiety in the patients of the experimental group.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Sled <italic>et al</italic>., (2010) did a research to study the effects of hip abductors strengthening home protocol on knee osteoarthritis.

The results showed improvement in the parameters measured by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) questionnaire and reduced pain in VAS.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Yoga is one of the least harming sports with proven positive physiological and mental effects in treatment of chronic conditions.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Osteoarthritis is one of the most common inflammatory conditions that involve the knee joint.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Although it's not fatal, most of the patients have to suffer chronic pain and knee problems if it's left untreated.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Because yoga is very popular and the studies on effects of this sport on patients with knee osteoarthritis are limited, we decided to do this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>Methodology of this study was semi-experimental in execution and applicable in results.
