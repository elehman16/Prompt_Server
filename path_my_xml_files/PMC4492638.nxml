The diagnosis and selection of hypertensive and diabetic cases depended on patients&#x02019; self-reporting and this was then proven by patients&#x02019; medical history records obtained from the health care center. All of the diabetic patients had type-2 DM. Participants were eligible if they had a high CRP level (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP] &#x02265;6 mg/L). Patients were excluded if they had any acute illness within the past 2 weeks, regularly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (naproxen and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors) and/or cholesterol-lowering agents (statins), suffered from systemic and inflammatory diseases that change physical or laboratory tests (arthritis, renal, thyroid, hepatic, respiratory, gout, active malignant disease, pregnancy, breastfeeding), and/or documented intolerability to vitamin C.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design and intervention</title><p>The clinical trial was randomized, open-label, controlled, and parallel, and performed in compliance with the <italic>WMA</italic> [World Medical Association] <italic>Declaration of Helsinki: Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects</italic> adopted by the 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964, and amended by 59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, Korea, October 2008 (number: PHRC/HC/11/13, March 4, 2013). The trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of Universiti Putra Malaysia (June 21, 2013).

Patients in the experimental group were assigned to treatment with 1 g vitamin C per day (500 mg twice per day), while the control group was kept free of supplements. The vitamin C was supplied in tablets (C-Tamin-500 Tablets; Rekah Pharmaceutical Industry Ltd, Holon, Israel) containing 500 mg vitamin C. The decision to use 1 g of vitamin C daily was made based on the previous study of Block et al.<xref rid="b22-dddt-9-3405" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In that study, they used 515 mg of vitamin C for 8 weeks, the obtained variance between means (after treatment-baseline) of hs-CRP was 0.5 mg/L.

Further, no significant differences were found when comparing the groups in terms of the clinical variables hs-CRP, IL-6, FBG, TC, and TG.

In the vitamin C group, the changes appear in four variables after 8 weeks of intervention: hs-CRP, IL-6, FBG, and TG can be seen to have reduced significantly (overall, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). In the control group, the change appears in two variables after 8 weeks without added supplements: FBG (<italic>P</italic>=0.001) and TG (<italic>P</italic>=0.026). Due to the open-label nature of the study, the changes within the control group could be attributed to changes in lifestyle factors, such as eating habit or level of PA.</p><p>At the end of the study, after 8 weeks of treatment, in the vitamin C group, there were 31 valid patients and five patients who discontinued. In the control group, there were 33 valid patients and three patients who discontinued.

In the experimental group, significant reductions in hs-CRP and IL-6 levels were observed, and repeated tests between the experimental and control groups identified the clinical effectiveness of the intervention factor vitamin C in alleviating inflammation. The fact that treating the inflammatory status can be attributed to the effect of vitamin C is discussed following with reference to previous studies involving healthy and diseased populations.</p><p>Similar evidence is available to support the present results. Peluso et al<xref rid="b31-dddt-9-3405" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> found that mixed fruit-juice drink rich in vitamin C has the ability to reduce postprandial stress, mediated through IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;, in healthy overweight participants. Also, Jang et al<xref rid="b30-dddt-9-3405" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> proved that feeding animals a vitamin C rich diet could improve proinflammatory cytokine levels, including IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;. In the same context, consistent results were observed by Zhang et al<xref rid="b32-dddt-9-3405" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> who found that inflammatory status appeared with plasma vitamin C deficiency. Zhang et al&#x02019;s study aimed to find out the effect of vitamin C supplementation on inflammatory status in maintenance hemodialysis patients with low vitamin C level and high hs-CRP level. The study was conducted in two groups; in the first, patients were given 200 mg per day vitamin C for 3 months, then the vitamin C supplementation was withdrawn for the next 3 months. In the second group, patients were not given vitamin C in the first 3 months, then were orally administered with 200 mg vitamin C per day for the next 3 months.</p><p>Further, Mikirova et al<xref rid="b17-dddt-9-3405" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> summarized data of potentially therapeutic plasma ascorbate concentrations. Intravenous vitamin C can improve cancer outcome via modulated inflammation by reducing CRP. Block et al<xref rid="b33-dddt-9-3405" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> also investigated whether vitamins C or E could reduce CRP in healthy nonsmoker participants. Three groups were randomized into one of three groups: 1,000 mg per day vitamin C, 800 IU per day vitamin E, or placebo for 2 months. Among the participants with CRP indicative of elevated cardiovascular risk (&#x02265;1 mg/L), vitamin C was found to reduce median CRP by 25.3% vs placebo (<italic>P</italic>=0.02). Similarly, Block et al<xref rid="b22-dddt-9-3405" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> determined the effect of vitamin C in reducing plasma CRP in active and passive smokers. Participants in that study were randomized to receive placebo or vitamin C (515 mg/day), adjusted by BMI. The supplementation of vitamin C yielded a 24.0% reduction (95% confidence interval &#x02212;38.9 to &#x02212;5.5, <italic>P</italic>=0.036 compared with control) in plasma CRP.</p><p>In cross-sectional studies by Wannamethee et al<xref rid="b34-dddt-9-3405" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> evaluating the relationship between inflammatory markers and blood levels of vitamin C, the plasma level of vitamin C was found to be associated with a significant reduction in risk of heart failure in men with and without pre-existing myocardial infarction. The inverse association between plasma vitamin C and heart failure in men was explained by traditional risk factors involving reduction of CRP. Similarly, Wannamethee et al<xref rid="b35-dddt-9-3405" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> examined the cross-sectional associations between dietary and plasma vitamin C, and CRP for subjects free of DM or heart disease. Dietary and plasma vitamin C were significant inversely correlated with CRP (<italic>r</italic>=&#x02212;0.10 and <italic>r</italic>=&#x02212;0.16, respectively; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Moreover, Ford et al<xref rid="b16-dddt-9-3405" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> examined the cross-sectional relationship between CRP and vitamin C level, and found that CRP was significantly inversely associated with vitamin C.</p><p>Conversely, results different and inconsistent with the results of the present study were found by Aguil&#x000f3; et al<xref rid="b36-dddt-9-3405" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and Khajehnasiri et al.<xref rid="b37-dddt-9-3405" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Aguil&#x000f3; et al<xref rid="b36-dddt-9-3405" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> found 500 mg per day of vitamin C did not reduce the level of IL-6 induced by exercise after 15 days of supplementation. Similarly, Khajehnasiri et al<xref rid="b37-dddt-9-3405" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> undertook a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial to identify the role of vitamin C (250 mg twice a day) and/or omega-3 fatty acids (180 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid and 120 mg docosahexaenoic acid) in inflammatory markers among 136 shift workers with a depression score &#x02265;10 in 21-item Beck Depression Rating Scale for 60 days. Omega-3 plus vitamin C was associated with a decrease in depression score (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), and supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids without vitamin C was associated with a reduction in depression score (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) and hs-CRP concentration (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01), but no effect was observed for vitamin C alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect on FBG</title><p>In the present study, the effect of vitamin C on FBG was examined after 8 weeks of daily intake. It was found to have reduced significantly in both the experimental and control groups. In repeated tests between the experimental and control groups at the end point to identify the efficacy of vitamin C, clinical significance was achieved. The fact that treating the elevated level of FBG can be attributed to the effect of vitamin C can be observed from previous studies. For instance, Afkhami-Ardekani and Shojaoddiny-Ardekani<xref rid="b38-dddt-9-3405" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> found 1 g of vitamin C effectively reduced FBG and glycated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) in patients with type-2 DM, and Sargeant et al<xref rid="b39-dddt-9-3405" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> examined the cross-sectional association between plasma vitamin C and HbA<sub>1c</sub> in self-reported DM, finding that the mean plasma vitamin C level was significantly higher in individuals with HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels &#x0003c;7%.</p><p>However, different results were obtained by Siavash and Amini,<xref rid="b8-dddt-9-3405" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> who enrolled 50 patients with type-2 DM into three groups. The first group received 1 g vitamin C, the second received 600 mg gemfibrozil, and the third received a combination of both. The study aimed to find out the differences in lipid profile and blood glucose due to the interventions. The results indicate that vitamin C had similar effects to gemfibrozil on HDL-c but no effects on other lipid biomarkers or FBG. Similarly, Dakhale et al<xref rid="b40-dddt-9-3405" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> examined the effect of oral vitamin C with or without metformin on FBG, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and plasma ascorbic acid levels in type-2 DM patients in a randomized controlled trial lasting 12 weeks. Oral supplementation of vitamin C with metformin was found to reverse ascorbic acid levels in blood, reduce FBG, and improve HbA<sub>1c</sub>, while there was no meaningful result for vitamin C alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect on TC and TG</title><p>The present study examined the effect of vitamin C on TC and TG after 8 weeks of daily intake. In both the experimental and control groups, the level of TC was not affected by the intervention. In contrast, TG was found to be significantly reduced in both the experimental and control groups after 8 weeks. In repeated tests between the experimental and control group at the end point to identify the efficacy of vitamin C, the effect of vitamin C on both TC and TG did not reach clinical significance. Similar results have been observed for the effect of vitamin C on TC and TG. For example, Afkhami-Ardekani and Shojaoddiny-Ardekani<xref rid="b38-dddt-9-3405" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> found 1 g of vitamin C could effectively reduce TG level in type-2 DM patients but not the TC level. Likewise, Siavash and Amini<xref rid="b8-dddt-9-3405" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> found no valuable effects of vitamin C on any lipid biomarker except HDL-c.</p><p>Finally, in contrast, Peluso et al<xref rid="b31-dddt-9-3405" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> documented that the ingestion of a high fat meal with a fruit juice drink rich in vitamin C could significantly reduce plasma levels of TC and TG, and Gaur and Dixit<xref rid="b9-dddt-9-3405" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> found that TC was reduced by vitamin C intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>At baseline of the randomization process, we proved the balance between the groups to be approximate equality in terms of patient demographics and clinical variables. None of the patients&#x02019; characteristics violated this, so equality was assumed in all aspects. The strength of our study lies in the comparison between the experimental and control groups at the end point of the study. As far as we are aware, no previous studies have been interested in evaluating comparisons of the clinical efficacy of vitamin C, while the majority have been interested in within-group before and after tests only. Our results indicate a clear effect of 1 g of vitamin C in alleviating inflammatory markers (hs-CRP and IL-6) among hypertensive and/or diabetic obese adults. Also, vitamin C strongly affected the level of FBG, significantly reducing it after 8 weeks of daily intake. For the lipid-profile variables TC and TG, our results are consistent with those of Afkhami-Ardekani and Shojaoddiny-Ardekani<xref rid="b38-dddt-9-3405" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> who found a positive effect of vitamin C on TG but no effect on TC.</p><p>We found that a moderate amount of vitamin C can significantly treat and reduce the inflammation, as measured by hs-CRP and IL-6, in hypertensive and/or diabetic adults and also helps to reduce FBG levels. Additional studies of different durations are needed to further explore the role of vitamin C in the lipid profile.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors extend sincere thanks to the patients for their willingness to participate in this study.
