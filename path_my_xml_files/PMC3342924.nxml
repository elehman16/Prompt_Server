Current 5-year survival following R0-resection of liver metastases is 28-39%, but recurrence eventually occurs in up to 70%. To date, adjuvant chemotherapy has not improved clinical outcomes significantly. The primary objective of the ongoing LICC trial (<bold>L</bold>-BLP25 <bold>I</bold>n <bold>C</bold>olorectal <bold>C</bold>ancer) is to determine whether L-BLP25, an active cancer immunotherapy, extends recurrence-free survival (RFS) time over placebo in colorectal cancer patients following R0/R1 resection of hepatic metastases. L-BLP25 targets MUC1 glycoprotein, which is highly expressed in hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer. In a phase IIB trial, L-BLP25 has shown acceptable tolerability and a trend towards longer survival in patients with stage IIIB locoregional NSCLC.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a multinational, phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a sample size of 159 patients from 20 centers in 3 countries. Patients with stage IV colorectal adenocarcinoma limited to liver metastases are included. Following curative-intent complete resection of the primary tumor and of all synchronous/metachronous metastases, eligible patients are randomized 2:1 to receive either L-BLP25 or placebo. Those allocated to L-BLP25 receive a single dose of 300 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>cyclophosphamide (CP) 3 days before first L-BLP25 dose, then primary treatment with s.c. L-BLP25 930 &#x003bc;g once weekly for 8 weeks, followed by s.c. L-BLP25 930 &#x003bc;g maintenance doses at 6-week (years 1&#x00026;2) and 12-week (year 3) intervals unless recurrence occurs. In the control arm, CP is replaced by saline solution and L-BLP25 by placebo. Primary endpoint is the comparison of recurrence-free survival (RFS) time between groups. Secondary endpoints are overall survival (OS) time, safety, tolerability, RFS/OS in MUC-1 positive cancers. Exploratory immune response analyses are planned. The primary endpoint will be assessed in Q3 2016. Follow-up will end Q3 2017.

Stimuvax<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>(BLP25 Liposome Vaccine or L-BLP25) is an investigational therapeutic cancer vaccine co-developed by Oncothyreon Canada Inc. (formerly Biomira Inc., Edmonton, Canada), and Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany for the use as an active specific immunotherapy for MUC1- expressing tumors. Details of the physical, chemical and pharmaceutical properties, the non-clinical trials and effects and safety in humans have been published elsewhere 2008) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Colorectal cancer is amongst the three most frequent malignancies in Western countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Survival is delineated by local recurrence, by lymphatic and predominantly by hematogenous dissemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Mutations in tumor suppressor genes (APC, DCC, Smad-2, Smad-4, p53) and oncogenes (K-ras) are molecular determinants occurring during the development of sporadic colorectal cancer, which was first summarized in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence described by Vogelstein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Since only 8% of colorectal cancers harbor concomitant mutations of APC, K-ras, and p53, it seems very likely that additional pathogenic alterations instrumentally mediate progression and metastasis of colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>At the time of first diagnosis, about 35% of colorectal cancer patients have distant metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Distant metastases limited to the liver occur in 15-20% of all patients initially diagnosed with colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, only 15-20% of synchronic hepatic metastases are resected by surgery. Complete surgical resection of hepatic metastases represents the only curative option: cure is otherwise not attainable. The 5-year survival after R0-resection of liver metastases ranges between 28% to 39% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Unfortunately, recurrence rates after R0 resection of hepatic metastases peak at up to 70% in the long-term follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The decision as to whether metastases are to be treated by surgical resection or by other therapeutic options such as neoadjuvant chemotherapy, should be discussed and determined by interdisciplinary tumor boards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The requirements for surgical resections are (i) that there is no evidence of extra-hepatic tumor, (ii) less than 70% of the liver is tumor-bearing, (iii) fewer than 3 liver veins and fewer than 7 segments of the liver are affected. Further exclusion criteria for surgical resection of liver metastases are the presence of CHILD B/C cirrhosis and/or other severe concomitant diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Using scoring systems such as that described by Fong, the prognosis can be estimated preoperatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The existence of at least two Fong points predicts a median survival of 47 months after surgical resection of liver metastasis. However, the Fong score is only an indirect correlation of evaluated parameters (N-stage, size and number of metastases, preoperative CEA value and duration of disease-free interval) with the probability of incidence of organ metastasis. Organ-bound micro-metastases (MM) or disseminated tumor cells (DTC) are considered precursors of metachronic solid liver metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>A relevant clinical problem after primary or secondary resection of hepatic metastases is the high recurrence rate, ranging up to 70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. According to de Jong and colleagues, the median RFS after resection of liver metastases is 23 months andthe median OS 36 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The application of classical chemotherapeutic strategies has not been sufficiently successful. Adjuvant 5-FU has non-significantly increased recurrence free survival (RFS 1.6 yrs. vs. 2.3 yrs.; P = 0.06), however this did not translate into a prolonged overall survival (4.0 vs. 5.0 years; P = 0.09) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Similar data was published by Portier et al., prolonging the 5-year-RFS (33.5% vs. 26.7%; P = 0.028) without augmenting the 5-year-survival (51.1% vs. 41.1% P = 0.13) by an adjuvant 5-FU therapy (EBM grade 2b) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Parks et al. found that a 5-FU based adjuvant chemotherapy versus watch and wait significantly improved postoperative overall survival (P = 0.007); however these data were retrospectively analysed registered data and thus not applicable (EBM grade 3b) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Nordlinger's approach using peri-operative FOLFOX non-significantly increased the 3-yrs RFS by 7.3% (28.1% vs. 35.4%;P = 0.058); however patients treated per protocol (per protocol analysis) benefited even more (9.2%; 3-yrs. RFS 33.2% vs. 42.2%; P = 0.025) (EBM grade 1b) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Other studies are limited by small numbers and do not augment EBM grade 2b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>The German S3 Guideline recommends surgery of primary resectable liver metastases (recommendation grade A; evidence grade 3b; strong consensus). In contrast, a neoadjuvant chemotherapy of primary resectable metastases is considered optional and is limited to well-defined, exceptional cases (recommendation grade 0; evidence grade 3, strong consensus). Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy after curative R0 resection of hepatic metastases is considered optional ("can be considered"; recommendation grade B; evidence grade 2, strong consensus) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In contrast, according to the current consensus of the "European colorectal metastases treatment group" use of neoadjuvant/peri-operative combination chemotherapy (e.g. FOLFOX) is suggested in the case of primary resectable liver metastases whereas for potentially resectable liver metastases a neo-adjuvant combination chemotherapy (e.g. FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) plus application of a targeted therapy (bevacizumab, cetuximab, panitumumab) should be considered. Isolated adjuvant strategies are not recommended by the working group.</p><p>In summary, no generally accepted standard of care is available following curative-intent resection of hepatic metastases in colorectal cancer patients. L-BLP25 is a therapeutic vaccine that targets MUC1, a well known tumor-associated antigen. Recently, it has been shown that MUC1 is associated with cellular transformation as demonstrated by tumorigenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and can confer resistance to genotoxic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. High levels of MUC1 cell surface expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], reported immunosuppressive activities of its released ectodomain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and anti-adhesive properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] all contribute to the ability of the MUC1 antigen to protect and promote tumor cell growth and survival, making MUC1 an attractive target for cancer immunotherapy.</p><p>Based on these results, L-BLP25 has a promising potential as adjuvant therapy after curative-intent resection of hepatic metastases in colorectal cancer patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Investigational medicinal product</title><p>L-BLP25 is a lyophilized preparation, formulated to contain 241 &#x003bc;g of BLP25 lipopeptide and 128 &#x003bc;g of immunoadjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A in a 5 mL glass vial. The vial also contains 13,63 mg of liposomal lipids consisting of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), cholesterol and dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DMPG). The BLP25 lipopeptide and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) are associated with the lipid bilayer of the liposomes that are formed upon rehydration of the dry powder (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The active mechanism of L-BLP25 is mediated by the entire liposome formed after reconstitution. Only the entire liposomal formulation, in which the antigen and adjuvant are integrated into the lipid bi-layer, is capable of inducing the desired immune response against MUC1. L-BLP25 was designed principally to induce a cellular immune response to tumor tissues that express the MUC1 antigen. This cellular response is characterized by the proliferation of CD4-positive T cells in response to peptide, along with production of gamma interferon and the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) capable of killing MUC1-expressing tumor cells. The BLP25 lipopeptide provides the antigenic specificity for the T cell response, while the monophosphoryl lipid A serves as an adjuvant to enhance the cellular immune responses. The liposomal delivery system is designed to facilitate uptake of the vaccine by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) delivering the lipopeptide into the intracellular space, finally leading to presentation of peptides via class I and class II molecules of the HLA complex. This is expected to elicit a MUC1-specific cellular immune response mediated by T lymphocytes, including a CTL response. Further information on the immunological background supporting L-BLP25 and information on the immunization schedule can be found in the Investigators Brochure. Humoral responses to L-BLP25 are not expected, based on the specific formulation of the vaccine, and were found in only a few patients at low levels in previous clinical trials (EMR 63325-002, -003, and -004).

Secondary objectives are the comparative assessment of overall survival (OS) time, safety/tolerability, recurrence-free survival time in the subgroup of MUC1 positive cancers, and overall survival in the subgroup of MUC1 positive cancers. MUC1 expression analysis and immuno-monitoring parameters are to be defined in separate translational protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial design and plan</title><p>This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, double-blinded, efficacy/safety study of L-BLP25 in patients with complete-resected metastatic CRC. Eligible patients will have had their primary tumor resected and have undergone curative-intent resection of liver metastases within the last 6 weeks. Eligible patients will be randomized to treatment with L-BLP25 vaccine versus placebo (2:1). Treatment will be discontinued upon documented relapse or, if subjects are free of relapse, treatment will be discontinued 3 years after the first vaccination of the maintenance phase. Randomization of 159 subjects (106 to the investigational arm and 53 to the control arm) was calculated. The enrollment period is expected to run from Q3 2011 to Q3 2013. The sample size considerations are based on the following assumptions:</p><p>&#x02022; 2:1 randomization (106 pts.

No generally accepted adjuvant or perioperative strategies are available, significantly reducing the recurrence rate or prolonging overall survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. According to the German S3 guideline, adjuvant chemotherapy after R0 resection of liver metastases can be considered, whereas neo-adjuvant chemotherapy prior to resection of liver metastases can be considered in reasonable exceptional cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In contrast, R0 resectable metastases limited to the liver should be resected. In summary, the recommendation for neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy is currently not strong in Germany. As the majority of centers is located in Germany we decided to comply with the German guidelines, knowing that peri-operative chemotherapy is considered standard of care in some other countries.</p><p>Participating centers confirmed the acceptance of the protocol containing a placebo arm. The standard treatment of care after resection of liver metastases in the participating centers is to watch and wait. As a consequnce, the study offers a potentially effective verum treatment to two thirds of participating patients, which would not receive any treatment otherwise.</p><p>In addition, we accept patients treated in a neoadjuvant manner, if the neoadjuvant therapy has lasted 12 weeks or less. This is necessary, as some patients have been treated in a neoadjuvant setting, but the patients are presented for the study only post surgery. As a short chemotherapy does not interfere with the postoperative immune system capacity, we agreed to include those patients. A significant impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy has not been proven so far. Thus, the ethics committee and the Paul-Ehrlich-Institute accepted inclusion criteria.</p><p>CRC is reported to have MUC1 expression in ~61% of pT1, 78% of pT2, 98% of pT3 and 90% of pT4 colorectal cancer samples and thus clearly correlates with invasiveness, being an optimal target for MUC1 based vaccination strategies after resection of hepatic metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In addition, MUC1 expression was found in 100% (56/56) of colorectal cancer liver metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. A MUC1 expression of &#x0003e; 85% is expected in the study population analyzed, as the vast majority of metastatic cases will be pT3/pT4. It has been well discussed, that an engagement of the immune system might be the most successful therapeutic option to reduce micro-metastases and thus decreased recurrence rates and increase recurrence free survival time and overall survival time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>L-BLP25 is designed to induce cellular cytotoxicity towards MUC1 expressing tumor cells. Doses of 1,000 &#x003bc;g have increased overall survival time in NSCLC patients from 13.3 months to 30.0 months in patients with stage IIIB disease without pleural effusion (HR 0.55) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. A similar effect would be highly beneficial for patients after hepatic metastasectomy who have a high recurrence risk (70%) with a median time to recurrence of ~18-23 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Thus, we aim to test L-BLP-25 vaccine in a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, double blinded, safety/efficacy study in patients with metastatic CRC. Eligible patients will have had their primary tumor resected and will have undergone curative-intent resection of liver metastases (R0/R1) within the last 6 weeks. Since the percentage of colorectal cancers expressing MUC1 is very high, MUC1 testing results are not required prior to inclusion. Further, the significance of detection of MUC1 expression in a tumor sample is unclear, due to the fact that this may not mean that the tumor is truly negative for MUC1, patients whose tumors are not shown to be expressing MUC1 can be included into this study. Eligible patients will be randomized via IVRS to treatment with L-BLP-25 versus placebo (2:1). Treatment will be discontinued upon documented relapse or if subjects are free from relapse, treatment will be discontinued 3 years after first application.</p><p>The dose regimen and treatment schedule will be the same as those used in Trial EMR 63325-001 (worldwide phase III, START). Throughout the development of L-BLP25, a single low-dose of cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>to a maximum of 600 mg) has been administered prior to initiation of treatment with L-BLP25. The purpose is to overcome the immune suppression seen in cancer subjects and thus to enhance the development of an effective immune response to the MUC1 immunogen present in the vaccine.</p><p>We also decided to accept patients treated in a neo-adjuvant manner, if the neoadjuvant therapy has lasted 12 weeks or less. This became necessary, as some patients have been treated in a neo-adjuvant setting, but are presented for the study evaluation only post surgery. As a short chemotherapy seems not interfere with the postoperative immune system capacity, we agreed to include those patients in order to optimize accrual.</p><p>Patients in the investigational arm receive cyclophosphamide prior to immunotherapy, in an attempt to overcome the immune suppression seen in cancer subjects. Therefore, to maintain the double-blind design, subjects in the control arm will receive saline solution in the same calculated dose volume as that of cyclophosphamide.</p><p>The design and implementation of the current vaccination study in colorectal cancer is feasible. The study will provide recurrence-free and overall survival rates of groups in an unbiased fashion.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CCS is the principal investigator.
