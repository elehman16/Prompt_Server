The efficacy and safety of canagliflozin were evaluated in subjects with T2DM inadequately controlled with diet and exercise.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, subjects (N = 584) received canagliflozin 100 or 300 mg or placebo once daily. Primary endpoint was the change from baseline in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at week 26. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c &#x0003c; 7.0%; change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h postprandial glucose (PPG) and systolic blood pressure (BP); and percent change in body weight, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At week 26, HbA1c was significantly reduced from baseline with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg compared with placebo (&#x02212;0.77, &#x02212;1.03 and 0.14%, respectively; p &#x0003c; 0.001 for both). Both canagliflozin doses significantly decreased FPG, 2-h PPG, body weight and systolic BP (p &#x0003c; 0.001 for all), and increased HDL-C compared with placebo (p &#x0003c; 0.01 for both). Overall incidences of AEs were modestly higher with canagliflozin versus placebo; rates of serious AEs and AE-related discontinuations were low and similar across groups. Incidences of genital mycotic infections, urinary tract infections and osmotic diuresis-related AEs were higher with canagliflozin; these led to few discontinuations. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was low across groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Canagliflozin treatment improved glycaemic control, reduced body weight and was generally well tolerated in subjects with T2DM inadequately controlled with diet and exercise.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>phase 3 study</kwd><kwd>SGLT2 inhibitor</kwd><kwd>type 2 diabetes</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The substantial increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) over the past decade is associated with a marked increase in the prevalence of obesity, which contributes greatly to insulin resistance, a key pathophysiologic parameter observed especially in individuals at risk. Given the role of obesity and sedentary lifestyles in contributing to the progression of T2DM, the first step in T2DM management is lifestyle change, exercise and weight loss; unfortunately, such interventions are often inadequate or short-lived in effectiveness. When non-pharmacological treatment fails, treatment with an antihyperglycaemic agent (AHA), often metformin, is initiated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>]. Metformin provides effective control, although some patients do not tolerate metformin due to gastrointestinal side-effects or have contraindications to the use of this agent, such as renal insufficiency. Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease; initially, inadequate &#x003b2;-cell compensation for the increased demand in insulin due to insulin resistance precipitates hyperglycaemia; subsequent deterioration in &#x003b2;-cell function (&#x003b2;CF) and mass underlies the progression from non-pharmacological treatment through monotherapy failure, to the need for combination treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>]. Current oral AHA classes often do not provide sufficiently effective or durable glycaemic control with improved &#x003b2;CF; although metformin provides modest weight reduction, most oral agents lead to weight gain or are weight neutral, but do not substantively reduce body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>]. The recent American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes position statement suggests that therapy should be individualized and tailored to the specific needs of each patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>]. Therefore, there is a need for new AHAs that can provide long-term glycaemic control and additional benefits such as minimal hypoglycaemia and favourable effects on weight.</p><p>Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a class of AHAs in development that have a mechanism of action different from those of current therapies, with a primary effect on renal glucose handling. Specifically, induction of urinary glucose excretion (UGE) via inhibition of renal glucose reabsorption by SGLT2 provides an insulin-independent mechanism for lowering blood glucose and improving glycaemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>]. Under normal conditions, almost all filtered glucose is reabsorbed until the filtered load exceeds the glucose resorptive capacity. The plasma glucose concentration at which renal resorptive capacity is exceeded and UGE occurs is called the renal threshold for glucose (RT<sub>G</sub>). Renal glucose resorptive capacity is increased in T2DM, contributing to the worsening of hyperglycaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>]. Canagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor in development for the treatment of T2DM, lowers the RT<sub>G</sub> (range of 4.4&#x02013;5.0 mmol/l), thereby increasing UGE and resulting in decreased plasma glucose, a mild osmotic diuresis and increased caloric loss (4 kcal/g of glucose), with a low potential for hypoglycaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>]. The loss of glucose with attendant caloric loss contributes to weight loss; in addition, improvements in &#x003b2;CF have been seen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>]. This clinical profile suggests that canagliflozin might be a useful therapeutic agent to treat patients with T2DM from early in the disease, as monotherapy, to later in the disease, in combination treatments. This 26-week, phase 3, CANagliflozin Treatment And Trial Analysis &#x02013; Monotherapy (CANTATA-M) study evaluated the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin compared with placebo in subjects with T2DM inadequately controlled with diet and exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects and Study Design</title><p>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study was conducted in 17 countries (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01081834). The study included both subjects with inadequate control on diet and exercise and subjects on an AHA, who underwent a washout of the agent. Subjects not on an AHA directly entered a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period (week &#x02212;2 to day 1), while subjects on an AHA underwent an 8-week, AHA washout/diet and exercise period followed by the placebo run-in period. After the placebo run-in period, all subjects were randomized into a 26-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, core treatment period, followed by a 26-week, double-blind extension period. This publication reports the results of the 26-week core treatment period.</p><p>Eligible subjects were men and women 18&#x02013;80 years of age with T2DM who met one of the two following criteria: (i) not on an AHA at screening with haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) &#x02265;7.0 and &#x02264;10.0% or (ii) on AHA monotherapy [except peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x003b3; (PPAR&#x003b3;) agonist] or metformin plus sulfonylurea combination therapy (at &#x02264;50% of maximally or near-maximally effective doses) with HbA1c &#x02265;6.5 and &#x02264;9.5% at screening and HbA1c &#x02265;7.0 and &#x02264;10.0% and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) &#x0003c;15.0 mmol/l at week &#x02212;2.</p><p>For subjects with HbA1c values above the inclusion range (HbA1c &#x02265;7.0 and &#x02264;10.0%), a substudy was conducted to assess the efficacy in elevated glycaemic states. Subjects were eligible to participate in the high glycaemic substudy if they had HbA1c &#x0003e;10.0 and &#x02264;12.0% at screening or week &#x02212;1 and FPG &#x02264;19.4 mmol/l at week &#x02212;1. Subjects eligible for this substudy entered a 1-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period followed by a 26-week, double-blind, active-treatment period. Given the poorer glycaemic control, all subjects received active treatment with canagliflozin 100 or 300 mg; double-blinding was to the dose of canagliflozin. Subjects in the high glycaemic substudy were not eligible for the 26-week extension period. In this report, the placebo-controlled study component will be referred to as the &#x02018;main study&#x02019;.</p><p>Subjects were excluded if they had repeated FPG measurements &#x0003e;15.0 mmol/l during the pre-treatment phase (or &#x0003e;19.4 mmol/l for the high glycaemic substudy); a history of type 1 diabetes, hereditary glucose-galactose malabsorption, primary renal glucosuria or cardiovascular (CV) disease (including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, revascularization procedure or cerebrovascular accident); treatment with a PPAR&#x003b3; agonist, insulin, another SGLT2 inhibitor or any other AHA except as specified in the inclusion criteria within 12 weeks before screening; or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &#x0003c;50 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> at screening.</p><p>Subjects in the main study were randomly assigned to receive daily oral doses of canagliflozin 100 or 300 mg or placebo (1 : 1 : 1). Randomization was stratified according to whether subjects were taking AHAs at screening and whether they participated in the frequently-sampled mixed-meal tolerance test (FS-MMTT). Subjects in the high glycaemic substudy were randomly assigned to receive canagliflozin 100 or 300 mg (1 : 1), with randomization stratified by whether subjects were taking AHAs at screening.</p><p>During the double-blind treatment period, glycaemic rescue therapy with metformin was initiated if FPG &#x0003e;15.0 mmol/l after day 1 to week 6, &#x0003e;13.3 mmol/l after week 6 to week 12 and &#x0003e;11.1 mmol/l after week 12 to week 26.</p><p>The study protocol and amendments were approved by the institutional review boards at participating institutions and the study was conducted under the guidelines of Good Clinical Practices and the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects provided written informed consent prior to participation.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Endpoints and Assessments</title><p>The pre-specified primary efficacy endpoint was the change in HbA1c from baseline to week 26. Pre-specified secondary endpoints included the proportion of subjects reaching HbA1c &#x0003c;7.0%, changes from baseline at week 26 in FPG and systolic blood pressure (BP) and percent changes from baseline in body weight, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides. Additional endpoints included changes in diastolic BP and other fasting plasma lipids, including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), non&#x02013;HDL-C and the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio. Change from baseline in apolipoprotein B (Apo B) was assessed in a subset of subjects in the main study (based on availability of paired baseline and week 26 archive samples).</p><p>On day 1 and at week 26, all subjects underwent a standard MMTT (&#x0223c;700 kcal and 100 g of carbohydrates) to assess the pre-specified secondary endpoint, change from baseline in 2-h postprandial glucose (PPG), and indices of &#x003b2;CF, including Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA2-%B), proinsulin/insulin ratio and proinsulin/C-peptide ratio (<italic>post hoc</italic> analysis). A FS-MMTT was performed in a subset of subjects in the main study (&#x0223c;50% of total subjects at selected sites) for measures of &#x003b2;CF including the ratio of C-peptide area under the concentration-time curve (AUC<sub>C</sub>) to glucose AUC (AUC<sub>G</sub>). During the FS-MMTT, blood samples were collected 15 min before and immediately prior to the meal, and 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min after the meal.</p><p>Safety and tolerability were assessed based on adverse event (AE) reports, safety laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, physical examinations and 12-lead electrocardiograms. AEs pre-specified for additional data collection included urinary tract infections (UTIs) and genital mycotic infections. Documented hypoglycaemia episodes included biochemically confirmed episodes (concurrent fingerstick or plasma glucose &#x02264;3.9 mmol/l, irrespective of symptoms) and severe hypoglycaemia episodes (i.e., requiring the assistance of another individual or resulting in seizure or loss of consciousness).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Sample size determination for the main study was based on the comparison of canagliflozin with placebo in the change in HbA1c from baseline to week 26. An estimated 85 randomized subjects per group were needed to achieve at least 90% power, assuming a group difference of 0.5% and a common standard deviation (s.d.) of 1.0%. To enhance the safety database for canagliflozin, approximately 150 randomized subjects were planned for inclusion per group. Sample size determination was not required for the high glycaemic substudy because there were no comparisons pre-specified for hypothesis testing; 50&#x02013;100 subjects were targeted for enrollment to provide a reasonable experience at each dose for efficacy, safety and tolerability assessments.</p><p>Efficacy and safety analyses for the main study and the high glycaemic substudy were performed separately using the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population consisting of all randomized subjects who received &#x02265;1 dose of the study drug. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach was used to impute missing efficacy data. For subjects who received rescue therapy, the last post-baseline value prior to the initiation of rescue therapy was used for the efficacy analyses.</p><p>Primary and continuous secondary endpoints were analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment and stratification factors as fixed effects and the corresponding baseline value as a covariate. The least squares (LS) mean differences between groups (each canagliflozin dose versus placebo) and the associated two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated based on this model. The categorical secondary efficacy endpoint (proportion of subjects reaching HbA1c &#x0003c;7.0%) was analyzed using a logistic model with treatment and stratification factors as fixed effects and baseline HbA1c as a covariate.</p><p>Descriptive statistics with 95% CIs were provided for the change from baseline in HbA1c for subgroups with baseline HbA1c &#x0003c;8%, &#x02265;8 to &#x0003c;9% and &#x02265;9%. For indices of &#x003b2;CF, descriptive statistics and 95% CIs for the changes from baseline were provided; LS mean differences versus placebo at week 26 were assessed using the same ANCOVA model as for the primary endpoint.</p><p>A pre-specified hierarchical testing sequence was implemented to strongly control for overall type I error due to multiplicity. Two-sided statistical tests were conducted at the 5.0% significance level for all endpoints except systolic BP, HDL-C and triglycerides. Systolic BP, HDL-C and triglycerides were grouped together into two separate families, one each for canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg. Each family was tested using the Hochberg procedure controlling for multiplicity at the 2.5% significance level. P-values were calculated by comparing LS means and are reported for pre-specified comparisons only. Descriptive statistics were provided for endpoints for the high glycaemic substudy.</p><p>All AEs are reported including all data, regardless of rescue medication, except for osmotic diuresis- and volume-related AEs, which are reported excluding data after initiation of rescue therapy. Safety analyses for laboratory results excluded data after initiation of rescue therapy, including data up to within 2 days after the last dose of study drug.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Subject Disposition and Baseline Characteristics</title><sec><title>Main Study</title><p>Among the 587 subjects randomized in the main study, 584 received &#x02265;1 dose of study medication and were included in the mITT analysis set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">figure 1</xref>). A total of 77 (13.1%) subjects discontinued prior to week 26; slightly higher rates of discontinuation were seen with placebo (16.5%) than with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg (11.7 and 11.2%, respectively). A lower percentage of subjects treated with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg (2.6 and 2.0%, respectively) received glycaemic rescue therapy compared with placebo-treated subjects (22.7%).

Substudy</title><p>Canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg were generally well tolerated in the substudy, with a rate of overall AEs (61.7 and 50.0%, respectively) similar to that observed in the main study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S2</xref>). There were only two discontinuations due to AEs (one in each treatment group) and one serious AE (not considered related to the study drug). Rates of genital mycotic infections and UTIs were generally consistent with those observed in the main study; no AEs related to reduced intravascular volume (e.g. postural hypotension), and only one AE related to osmotic diuresis (e.g. pollakiuria), were reported. There were no reports of hypoglycaemia in the substudy. Similar to the main study, small differences in the change from baseline for serum creatinine, BUN and serum urate were observed in the two canagliflozin groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S3</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study of subjects with T2DM who had inadequate glycaemic control with diet and exercise, treatment with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg provided clinically important and statistically significant improvements in glycaemic control compared with placebo over 26 weeks; these improvements were associated with weight loss with both doses of canagliflozin. Both canagliflozin doses were generally well tolerated and were associated with a low incidence of hypoglycaemia. Of note, this study included subjects with normal renal function as well as those with mild or moderate renal impairment (chronic kidney disease, Stages 2 and 3), with an exclusion criterion of eGFR &#x0003c;50 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>In the main study, reductions in HbA1c, FPG and PPG were observed with both canagliflozin doses. A large proportion of subjects reached HbA1c &#x0003c;7.0% with canagliflozin, and few subjects required glycaemic rescue therapy. Relative to canagliflozin 100 mg, canagliflozin 300 mg provided greater effects on glycaemic endpoints, body weight and systolic BP; similar increases in HDL-C were observed with both doses. Because canagliflozin 300 mg provides more sustained maximal decrease in RT<sub>G</sub> than canagliflozin 100 mg, the incremental efficacy observed was anticipated. Doses of canagliflozin &#x0003e;200 mg have been reported to decrease post-meal glucose excursions, potentially through delayed glucose absorption (related to transient inhibition of the gut SGLT1 transporter due to high gut luminal concentrations of drug prior to drug absorption) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>], which could also contribute to the incrementally greater efficacy seen with canagliflozin 300 mg. Clinical mechanism of action studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>] have confirmed delayed gastrointestinal glucose absorption with canagliflozin 300 mg in healthy volunteers and subjects with T2DM.</p><p>Addressing obesity is an important part of T2DM management, helping to lower insulin resistance and contributing to improvements in glycaemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>]. In addition to providing glycaemic improvements, canagliflozin treatment provided body weight reductions in this study. Because many of the traditional therapies for T2DM result in weight gain, the added benefit of weight loss with canagliflozin is clinically useful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>]. Canagliflozin was also associated with significant decreases in systolic BP (with no compensatory increase in pulse rate) and increases in HDL-C, but showed modest, dose-related increases in LDL-C. Smaller increases than those in LDL-C were observed in non&#x02013;HDL-C and Apo B; the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio was slightly decreased across groups. The mechanism for the LDL-C increase with canagliflozin is not known, but may be related to the metabolic changes associated with UGE. Improvements in HDL-C and triglycerides are likely related to the improved glycaemic control and weight loss associated with canagliflozin. Taken together, multiple CV risk factors were positively modified in patients treated with canagliflozin. However, the impact of these changes on the overall risk for CV events should be further evaluated in larger CV outcome studies.</p><p>Improvements in fasting measures of &#x003b2;CF (HOMA2-%B, proinsulin/insulin ratio and proinsulin/C-peptide ratio) and AUC<sub>C</sub>/AUC<sub>G</sub> ratio during the FS-MMTT were seen with canagliflozin, consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>]. Because SGLT2 transporters are not present on &#x003b2;-cells, a direct mechanism for this improvement is unlikely; the improvements in &#x003b2;CF likely reflect reversal of glucotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>], and are possibly related to an &#x02018;unloading&#x02019; of the &#x003b2;-cell as glucose is partitioned out of the system through increased UGE. In this study, sustained glucose lowering was observed through 26 weeks; because deterioration of &#x003b2;CF underlies disease progression, the sustained glucose lowering observed may suggest improved durability; however, longer term assessments are needed to clarify this issue.</p><p>Canagliflozin was generally well tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with expectations based on earlier reports for SGLT2 inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>]. Slightly higher rates of overall AEs were seen with canagliflozin compared with placebo, primarily due to higher incidences of UTIs and genital mycotic infections, but these led to few discontinuations. Given the increase in UGE with canagliflozin, which induces an osmotic diuresis, the increased incidence of the related AEs of polyuria and pollakiuria was as expected. However, these events were generally mild or moderate in intensity and did not lead to discontinuations. Moreover, AEs related to reduced intravascular volume were infrequent and did not lead to discontinuations. Incidences of documented hypoglycaemia with canagliflozin were low and similar to those with placebo, with no report of severe hypoglycaemia in any group; this low incidence of hypoglycaemia was expected, as the reduction in RT<sub>G</sub> with canagliflozin has been reported to be in the 4.4 to 5.0 mmol/l range &#x02013; above the threshold for hypoglycaemia &#x02013; so that minimal further loss of urinary glucose would occur with canagliflozin as glucose levels are lowered close to the hypoglycaemic threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>].</p><p>In the high glycaemic substudy, both canagliflozin doses substantially improved glycaemic parameters and showed improvements in body weight, BP and HDL-C, similar to results from the main study. Notably, despite the markedly elevated baseline HbA1c (&#x0003e;10.0 and &#x02264;12.0%) in this cohort, single-agent treatment with canagliflozin resulted in 11.6 to 17.4% of subjects reaching HbA1c &#x0003c;7.0%. Because UGE is proportional to the glucose concentration above RT<sub>G</sub>, subjects with higher baseline glucose levels might be expected to show greater osmotic diuresis and potentially increased safety and tolerability issues with canagliflozin treatment. Notably, the safety and tolerability profile of canagliflozin in the high glycaemic cohort was similar to that seen in the main study population, with minimal occurrence of AEs related to osmotic diuresis (e.g. pollakiuria) or reduced intravascular volume (e.g. postural dizziness).</p><p>In conclusion, canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg significantly improved glycaemic control, reduced body weight and were generally well tolerated compared with placebo over 26 weeks in subjects with T2DM inadequately controlled with diet and exercise, suggesting that canagliflozin may be a useful therapeutic option in this setting.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was sponsored by Janssen Research &#x00026; Development, LLC.
