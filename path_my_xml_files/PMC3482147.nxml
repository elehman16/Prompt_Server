By quitting during pregnancy their infants will be protected from miscarriage and still birth as well as low birth weight, asthma, attention deficit disorder and adult cardiovascular disease. In the UK, the NICE guidelines: &#x02018;How to stop smoking in pregnancy and following childbirth&#x02019; (June 2010) highlighted that little evidence exists in the literature to confirm the efficacy of financial incentives to help pregnant smokers to quit. Its first research recommendation was to determine: Within a UK context, are incentives an acceptable, effective and cost-effective way to help pregnant women who smoke to quit?</p></sec><sec><title>Design and methods</title><p>This study is a phase II exploratory individually randomized controlled trial comparing standard care for pregnant smokers with standard care plus the additional offer of financial voucher incentives to engage with specialist cessation services and/or to quit smoking during pregnancy.</p><p>Participants (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;600) will be pregnant smokers identified at maternity booking who, when contacted by specialist cessation services, agree to having their details passed to the NHS Smokefree Pregnancy Study Helpline to discuss the trial. The NHS Smokefree Pregnancy Study Helpline will be responsible for telephone consent and follow-up in late pregnancy. The primary outcome will be self reported smoking in late pregnancy verified by cotinine measurement. An economic evaluation will refine cost data collection and assess potential cost-effectiveness while qualitative research interviews with clients and health professionals will assess the level of acceptance of this form of incentive payment. The research questions are: What is the likely therapeutic efficacy? Are incentives potentially cost-effective? Is individual randomization an efficient trial design without introducing outcome bias? Can incentives be introduced in a way that is feasible and acceptable?</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This phase II trial will establish a workable design to reduce the risks associated with a future definitive phase III multicenter randomized controlled trial and establish a framework to assess the costs and benefits of financial incentives to help pregnant smokers to quit.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN87508788</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Intervention</kwd><kwd>Maternal and child health</kwd><kwd>Outcomes</kwd><kwd>Pregnancy</kwd><kwd>Prevention</kwd><kwd>Smoking</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Smoking during pregnancy increases miscarriage and stillbirth, accounting for up to 4000 UK deaths annually, and pre-term birth and low birth weight leading to perinatal morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A third of excess stillbirths and post-natal deaths associated with living in deprived areas are explained by smoking during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In Scotland 70% of women have a baby [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], making pregnancy an opportunity to help most women quit before their health is permanently compromised. In 2009, 24% of women booking for maternity care self-reported as current smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Less than 1 in 20 of these women quit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. A study in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] in 2001 calculated the additional first year costs to health services as $1200 per smoker. Smoking is a major preventable cause of premature mortality for the mother, and lifelong benefits of quitting for children include reduced incidence of asthma and attention deficit disorder.</p><p>Following the 1998 White paper &#x02018;Smoking Kills&#x02019;, evidence-based National Health Service (NHS) smoking cessation services using behavioral support were developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and now exist throughout Scotland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Most of these services aim to provide tailored support (referred to in this paper as NHS Smokefree Pregnancy Services - NSPS) to pregnant women on a one-to-one basis, and evidence suggests that such interventions during pregnancy are effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is also offered, although its efficacy in pregnancy is not yet clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In Greater Glasgow &#x00026; Clyde (GG&#x00026;C), with 15,000 pregnancies per year, pregnant smokers identified at maternity booking are currently routinely referred to the NSPS on an &#x02018;opt-out&#x02019; basis, without consent for transfer of contact information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This practice is in keeping with the recent National Institute for health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Women are then contacted by NSPS advisers who ask if they would like to quit and offer a face-to-face appointment in a clinic or home setting. If the client attends they set a quit date and a risk assessment for use of NRT during pregnancy is performed.</p><p>Participation figures for areas with recognized specialist smoking cessation in pregnancy services from a Scotland-wide audit are shown below [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]:</p><p>A.

At present 25% deny their habit (A to B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This problem is being addressed by routinely testing all pregnant women at maternity booking for carbon monoxide using a breath test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Only half were referred (B to C) due to busy clinics and perceived client disapproval. Only 10% reached specialist cessation services such as those available in Glasgow (D). Nearly all of these &#x02018;set a quit date&#x02019; (E) and 3 in 10 (F) quit. Some improvement (E to F) may be possible as 4 in 10 quit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] with support from NHS cessation services in other parts of the UK.</p><p>Incentives are thought to increase participation and engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. If offered incentives, women who deny smoking may report as current smokers (A to B). Clients may self-refer or ask to be referred (B to C). With incentives, a greater proportion may engage (C to D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Improvement in the numbers quitting (D to F) will follow. In Scotland, when more pregnant smokers were referred, more engaged and more quit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>A 2009 Cochrane systematic review of interventions for promoting smoking cessation during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] asked: Do interventions improve quit rates?

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> is a funnel plot describing the outcome from all included trials showing intervention better than control to the left. Fewer small trials on the right (control better than intervention) indicates some publication bias so the pooled risk ratio 0.94 may overestimate any combined positive effect.

The first trial was conducted 25 years ago and only included incentives as a minor part of an extensive intervention. Other incentives trials were small [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and did not have a &#x02018;no incentive&#x02019; control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. None attempted to measure change in participation or engagement with an intervention. The NICE guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] issued in June 2010 highlighted that little evidence exists in the literature to confirm the efficacy of financial incentives to help pregnant smokers to quit. Its first research recommendation was: &#x0201c;Within a UK context, are incentives an acceptable, effective and cost-effective way to help pregnant women who smoke to quit?&#x0201d;</p><p>Since 2007, NHS Tayside in Scotland has piloted an incentives model - &#x000a3;12.50 per week of supermarket vouchers - to reward smoking cessation from quit date to 3 months after birth. The total payment for quitters is up to &#x000a3;650. The project has no formal contemporaneous control group but the number of women accessing cessation support has increased since incentives were introduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Women access the service at their local pharmacies, which provide NRT as well as support and validate whether the client has stopped smoking. This information initiates a payment onto a store card. During 2009, 169 (14%) of about 1200 pregnant smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] joined the program (the equivalent of engagement) and 94 (8%) women had quit smoking 4 weeks later; 42 were still quit at delivery (personal communication, Andrew Radley). This cessation rate is higher than those obtained by other Scottish smoking cessation in pregnancy services, where the average quit rate at 4 weeks is 3%, and the best 5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. A feasibility study for an incentives trial in Glasgow reported in January 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It explored how the Tayside program could be adapted for service configuration in Glasgow. The feasibility study provided the foundation for development of this trial.</p><p>This phase II trial will provide the tools required to run a future appropriately powered definitive phase III multicenter randomized controlled trial. The aim of that future phase III trial will be to establish whether or not incentives increase engagement with services, quit attempts and successful cessation to provide a more cost-effective pregnancy smoking cessation service model generalizable to the whole UK and beyond.</p></sec><sec><title>Design and methodology</title><sec><title>Population</title><p>In 2010 there were 58,051 births in Scotland with 14,155 (24%) to mothers resident in NHS GG&#x00026;C Health Board area.

In the NHS Greater Glasgow &#x00026; Clyde study area, 15,000 pregnancies are recorded at maternity booking; 5,000 are to smokers, some who conceal their habit, and 3,000 are identified at maternity booking by self-report as current smokers. Their information is routinely passed to NHS Smokefree Pregnancy Services (NSPS) using an automated system. Attempt is made to contact all self reported smokers. We estimate that 500 will not be contactable by NSPS and that 500 will decline permission for their details to be passed to the NHS Smokefree Pregnancy Study Helpline (Study Helpline). Once details have been passed, 500 will not be contactable leaving 1,500 contacted by the Study Helpline. We expect that 600 to 900 will decline consent leaving 600 to 900 who agree to enroll in the study over 12 months. Of these, 300 will be randomly allocated to the intervention group to be offered incentive payments as well as standard care to stop smoking during pregnancy and 300 will be randomly allocated to receive the offer of standard care without incentive payments to quit smoking.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-13-113-2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Research questions</title><sec><title><italic>Trial</italic></title><p>1.

Follow-up telephone contact will be attempted by NHS Smokefree Pregnancy Study Helpline at a random date between 34 and 38 weeks gestation allocated at the time of the initial randomization. A patient record check will be made by the NHS Smokefree Pregnancy Service administrator looking for stillbirth, miscarriage or patient death the week prior to the telephone contact at 34 to 38 weeks gestation. Miscarriage or stillbirth may not preclude a woman from receiving vouchers if they are in the intervention group.</p><p>Three attempts will be made to contact participants. If no contact is possible the participants will be followed up by the research nurse either by telephone or by a home visit after a contact detail check with the participant&#x02019;s General Practitioner. If participants self report as non-smokers then a research nurse will make an appointment to collect urine and saliva for cotinine estimation (as well as a breath test for carbon monoxide to trigger the incentive payment).</p><p>If successful contact is made, the participant will be asked: &#x02018;Have you smoked in the last 8 weeks?&#x02019; If yes &#x02018;Have you smoked more than 5 cigarettes in that time?&#x02019; Self report will be corroborated by cotinine estimation on saliva and urine. Urine (cut-off 44.7 ng/ml) or saliva (cut-off 14.2 ng/ml) cotinine will be measured by ABS laboratories limited (abslabs@biopark.org.uk).</p><p>The important aspect of the primary outcome for this phase II trial is the proportion of participants successfully followed up from the intervention but particularly the control group. If acceptable levels (about 90%) of participants can be successfully followed up with a similar proportion in the intervention and control groups, then individual randomization can be accepted as a design choice for a future phase III trial that does not produce significant bias due to differential loss to follow-up between groups.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Secondary outcomes</italic></title><p>Engagement with specialist pregnancy cessation services is achieved if the participant arrives at a first face-to-face appointment with the NSPS adviser and sets a quit date.</p><p>Quit at 4 weeks after quit date will be ascertained with the question &#x02018;Have you smoked in the last 2 weeks, even a puff?&#x02019; at routine telephone contact by the NSPS adviser. This will be corroborated by a carbon monoxide breath test collected at routine pharmacy visits to collect NRT. These data will be available from both intervention and control groups.</p><sec><title><italic>Birth weight</italic></title><p>The best methods to gather these data efficiently will be examined and tested. Maternal height and weight is recorded routinely at maternity booking and will be used to help clarify birth weight differences during data analysis. Babies of smokers are on average 300 g (10%) lighter than babies born to non-smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Unintended consequences</italic></title><p>We do not anticipate the provision of extra finance to participants will have any adverse effects. We are not systematically documenting adverse events that happen during pregnancy. We are, however, examining unintended consequences formally using in-depth interviews with a sample of enrolled clients. Such possible unintended consequences include, for instance, taking up smoking prior to maternity booking in order to receive incentive payments by stopping afterwards.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Health economics</italic></title><p>Economic analysis will be undertaken alongside the trial, utilizing the costs, resource use and effectiveness data generated within the trial. For example, the cost of financial incentives, NRT, service delivery, and so on, will be collected and combined with resource use data. The number of quitters at the end of the trial will be combined with the cost data to calculate the incremental cost per late pregnancy quitter. The secondary outcome measure of child birth weight is strongly related to health care costs. Birth weight will be used to determine any difference in weight and therefore health care costs between neonates of mothers in the intervention group compared to mothers allocated to the control group.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Health economic assessment</italic></title><p>A within-trial analysis will explore the incremental cost per late pregnancy quitter, followed by a longer term analysis incorporating the cost to the NHS of any difference in birth weight due to smoking and looking at potential lifetime quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains to the mother and child.</p><p>A health economic model we previously developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] (which uses a Markov design to model the lifetime likelihood and impact of cessation, expressing the long-term health benefits of quitting smoking in terms of QALYs saved and the potential long-term reduced costs to the health service of cessation) will be used. This model will be adapted to incorporate the trial information and relevant published evidence in order to capture the short and longer term costs and health gains for both mother and child of smoking cessation during pregnancy. The outcomes will be presented in terms of the incremental cost per QALY saved. The model will be analyzed probabilistically in order to characterize uncertainty in the parameters, and estimate confidence limits around the cost and effectiveness outcomes. Areas of uncertainty identified within the model will help inform decisions about the potential value of future research. This model will ascertain whether any (and what type of) data should be collected to inform a more definitive economic evaluation and contribute to the optimal design of a Phase III trial.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Analysis</title><p>Analysis of outcomes will be by intention-to-treat, as the intervention is the offer of financial incentives to engage with cessation services and to quit smoking.</p><p>Differences by subgroup (maternity unit, deprivation score, age group, and so on) will be explored.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>The study is not designed to be able to detect a specified difference in the primary outcome of quit rate at 34 to 38 weeks gestation. The main objective is to inform the feasibility and design of a future definitive trial. However, assuming a quit rate of 4% in the usual care arm of the study, then with 600 participants the study will have 90% power to detect an increase in quit rates to 11.4%, or 80% power to detect an increase to 10.2%, based on a continuity-corrected <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> test at a 5% level of significance. Even if these outcome rates were achieved in this study, a Phase III study would be required to demonstrate that the intervention can be effective in other settings.</p></sec><sec><title>Overview of qualitative research components</title><sec><title><italic>Qualitative outcomes</italic></title><p>The qualitative research will take the form of a process evaluation designed to inform aspects of the proposed trial. It will contribute to:</p><p>&#x000b7; assessing the feasibility and acceptability to women and service providers of using incentives to promote cessation during pregnancy (including identification of barriers and facilitators).</p><p>&#x000b7; identifying any unintended consequences of participation.</p><p>&#x000b7; exploring responses to randomization approaches</p><p>&#x000b7; providing guidance on how the intervention might be modified for the Phase III randomized controlled trial.</p><p>Interviews will be conducted with small samples of (i) pregnant women and (ii) relevant professionals by researchers at Stirling University led by Susan MacAskill. This work will expand on qualitative research already undertaken with clients and professionals in relation to &#x02018;Give it up for Baby&#x02019;, the incentives scheme in Tayside [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Qualitative interviews will be conducted with pregnant women and professionals using semi-structured topic guides developed in line with the research aims. Topics will not be explored in a prescriptive manner but as part of an open discussion. This flexible format will enable additional salient topics and insights to emerge. In broad terms, the focus for the different respondent groups will be as follows:</p><p>One-to-one interviews with pregnant women (all of whom have engaged with the service) will explore views on issues around the delivery and promotion of the cessation service, response to incentive features and randomization, and any unintended consequences. Those interviewed prior to the trial start will be asked to respond to the concept of the incentives and the trial elements in addition to routine service elements, whilst those interviewed during the trial will also be asked to respond to these elements but based on personal experience of the trial.</p><p>Focus group interviews with pregnant women (smokers/recent ex-smokers) interviewed before the trial starts will also explore views on issues around the delivery and promotion of the cessation service, response to incentive features and randomization, and any unintended consequences. Responses can incorporate personal experiences, but will largely be based on response to the concept of these issues.</p><p>Interviews with professionals will explore issues around implementation of the intervention and the trial elements, identify challenges and ways they have been overcome, and perceived response among participants.</p><p>With the participants&#x02019; consent, all interviews and focus group discussions will be recorded as digital audio files, which will then be transcribed in full for thematic analysis. Transcripts will be organized using a thematic framework based on topics specified in the topic guide and emerging themes identified through a process of familiarization with transcript texts.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Sample and recruitment for the qualitative element</italic></title><p>Prior to the trial starting, up to 10 pregnant smokers will be recruited from amongst those already in contact with NSPS in Glasgow. Women will be informed about the study by specialist advisers on smoking in pregnancy and asked if they are interested in participating. Those interested will be provided with an information sheet and will be asked if their details can be passed to the lead qualitative researcher. Those who consent to their details being sent on will be contacted by phone to address any queries and to arrange an interview time and place. Alternatively, if they consent at the time of the initial information being provided, interviews can be conducted following their second session with the specialist advisor. Interviews will be conducted face to face and written consent obtained.</p><p>In addition, two one-off focus groups (4 to 8 respondents each) with pregnant women (incorporating smokers/recent ex-smokers) will be conducted. Women will be recruited by the researcher through ante-natal classes or other appropriate groups attended by pregnant women and again explanations will be given and consent sought to participate.</p><p>During the trial an additional 20 women will be interviewed after they have engaged with the trial. These will be different women from those interviewed prior to the trial. Pregnant smokers will be informed about this part of the study by the NHS Smokefree Pregnancy Study Helpline and asked if they are interested in participating in the interviews as part of the initial consent process. Details of those who express an interest and consent to be contacted will be passed to the research team. Points at which individuals will be interviewed will be spread across the pregnancy (that is, at around 4, 12 and 20 weeks post-set quit date). Mechanisms will be in place to ensure there are no contraindications prior to re-contacting those to be interviewed in later pregnancy (for example, any adverse pregnancy outcomes such as miscarriage). Both continued participants and those who have dropped-out will be included in the sample.</p><p>Respondents will be recruited from two hub areas in Glasgow and Clyde. All pregnant women participants will be offered &#x000a3;20 in recognition of their contribution to the study.</p><p>Professionals will also be interviewed as part of the qualitative study. They will be approached through appropriate organizational structures, facilitated by study co-applicants. Information sheets will be provided and consent obtained. The professional sample is intended to reflect a range of perspectives on implementation and the conduct of the trial. They will therefore include: pregnancy smoking cessation advisor(s) and manager, Clinical Research Facility nurse(s), interviews with the NHS Stop Smoking Study Helpline staff/managers, community midwives and manager, and community pharmacy facilitator(s). Professionals will be interviewed by telephone or face to face.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In Scotland, up to a third of pregnant women smoke throughout pregnancy. This is responsible for a third of miscarriages, still births and sudden infant deaths during the first year of life. There would be significant long-term health gains for mother and child if smokers quit during pregnancy. At present, less than 10% of pregnant smokers take up the offer of free smoking cessation services and only 3% quit during pregnancy. Modest incentive payments to engage with cessation services and/or to quit smoking may provide a substantial benefit by decreasing pregnancy health care costs and first-year health care costs. If women stay smoke-free, long-term health care costs will be substantially reduced. The results of this phase II trial will reduce the risks associated with funding a definitive phase III multicenter trial. The phase III trial will examine the costs and benefits of providing financial incentive payments for smoking cessation during pregnancy.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics approval</title><p>Ethics approval was received from West of Scotland REC2 on 25 May 2011.</p><p>Caldicott guardian approval was given on 3 February 2011 to allow NSPS GG&#x00026;C to pass information to the NHS Smokefree Pregnancy Study Helpline if the client gives verbal permission that contact details can be passed.</p><p>A major amendment to the trial protocol was approved on 6 March 2012 to allow use of anonymized qualitative interview data by the Health Technology Assessment Programme 10/31/02 BIBS: Benefits of Incentives for Breastfeeding and Smoking cessation: A platform study for a trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial organization</title><sec><title>Trial Steering Committee</title><p>The overall scientific aspects of the project will be managed by a Steering Committee.
