The incidence of myoclonus is highly variable (0-80%) and can be problematic in patients with open globe injuries or those at high risk of aspiration.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>The incidence of myoclonus can be reduced after premedication with either opioid or benzodiazepine.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Among the evaluated medications, both midazolam, and sufentanil, as pretreatment agents, have been reported to effectively reduce the myoclonus. However, a comparison between midazolam and sufentanil has not been made so far, and it is not clear which agent is a better option for reducing myoclonus after etomidate injection.</p><p>Therefore, we conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, clinical trial to compare the efficacy of midazolam and sufentanil in reducing the incidence and severity of myoclonus after etomidate injection in patients, undergoing elective ophthalmic surgery with general anesthesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>The current study was approved by the ethics committee of our university. All patients signed a written informed consent before participation. Fifty adult patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists class II or III, who were scheduled for elective eye surgery under general anesthesia, were selected for the study.</p><p>The exclusion criteria were allergy to benzodiazepine or opioid, neuropsychological or neuromuscular diseases, adrenal dysfunction or epilepsy, addiction; and analgesic or sedatives administration within 24 h before the procedure.</p><p>Patients did not receive premedication and were randomly assigned to one of the two groups (<italic>n</italic> = 25 per group) Group M consisted of patients receiving midazolam (0.015 mg/kg) and group S consisted of patients receiving sufentanil (0.2 &#x003bc;/kg). Randomization was performed using a computer-generated table. An anesthesiologist, who was blinded to the study and was not involved in anesthesia induction, prepared and coded syringes containing a total volume of 4 ml of medications. Patient monitoring included electrocardiography, pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure (BP) monitoring, and capnography.</p><p>Patients received isotonic saline solution (5 mL/kg) over 10 min at room temperature and were preoxygenated with 100% oxygen; then, the medication was injected over 30 s. Ninety seconds after pretreatment with the medication, etomidate (0.3 mg/kg) was intravenously injected within 20 s. Two minutes after intravenous (IV) administration of etomidate, anesthesia was completed by atracurium (0.5 mg/kg) and fentanyl (2 &#x003bc;/kg) to guarantee adequate anesthetic induction.</p><p>Patients were continuously monitored during anesthesia by one single physician, blinded to treatment procedures. Heart rate (HR), BP and mean arterial pressure (MAP) in pre- and post-induction (90 s after administration) were recorded.</p><p>The intensity of myoclonus was clinically graded as follows: 0 = no myoclonus, 1 = mild myoclonus (short movement of a body segment), 2 = moderate myoclonus (mild movements of two different muscles), and 3 = severe myoclonus (intense clonic movements in two or more muscle groups).[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical considerations</title><p>Based on previous studies, a minimum number of 23 patients were required in each group (with a significance level of 90% and a power of 80%).[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Hence, 25 patients in each group were included in this study.

Benzodiazepine has been shown to reduce etomidate-associated myoclonus.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] However, diazepam (0.0625-0.0125 mg/kg IV) or flunitrazepam (0.01 mg/kg IV) failed to reduce myoclonic movements.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] On the other hand, Doenicke <italic>et al</italic>. reported a significant reduction in the incidence of myoclonus when 0.1 mg/kg of diazepam was administrated 5 min before etomidate.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Schwarzkopf <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the incidence of myoclonic movements was significantly lower in patients, who were pretreated with midazolam 0.015 mg/kg (20%), compared to the placebo group (90%).[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In this study, all patients in the study groups were premeditated with oral midazolam; however, in our study, patients did not receive premedication.</p><p>In the study by Hwang <italic>et al</italic>., IV administration of midazolam 2 min before etomidate injection reduced the incidence of myoclonus up to 17%.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In the current study, the incidence of myoclonus in the midazolam-treated group was 84%, which was significantly higher than that observed in the study by Hwang. In the study by Hwang, etomidate was administered 2 min after midazolam (0.05 mg/kg); the higher dosage and longer interval in the study by Hwang may account for the lower incidence of myoclonus, following midazolam administration in their study, compared to ours.</p><p>Several opioids with different doses have been investigated as pretreatment medications to prevent myoclonus. Pretreatment with 100 &#x003bc;g of fentanyl reduced the incidence of myoclonus up to 8%.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Use of higher fentanyl doses (500 &#x003bc;g) significantly reduced myoclonic movements; however, the incidence of apnea increased during induction.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>In a study by Fassoulaki <italic>et al</italic>., they found no change in myoclonic occurrence when fentanyl 100 &#x003bc;g was administered before anesthesia induction with etomidate.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Remifentanil (1 &#x003bc;g/kg), administered 2 min before etomidate injection, was reported to reduce the incidence of myoclonus to 7%, without any clinically relevant side-effects.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In another study, pretreatment with remifentanil (with the same dose) was associated with a 17% incidence of myoclonus, which was higher than that observed in the study by Kelsaka <italic>et al</italic>. (7%). Furthermore, 10% of the remifentanil-treated patients experienced clinically relevant side-effects such as chest muscle rigidity and bradycardia. Therefore, their results suggested that remifentanil may not be a good option for routine pretreatment during etomidate injection.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Other investigators have recommended sufentanil (0.3 &#x003bc;g/kg) as a pretreatment agent before anesthesia induction with etomidate. In fact, this medication has been shown to completely prevent myoclonus without causing any side-effects.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Studies with other opioids such as alfentanil and buprenorphine have not shown higher efficiencies.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>In our study, pretreatment with sufentanil (0.2 &#x003bc;g/kg) was associated with a significantly reduced incidence and severity of myoclonus; however, pretreatment with midazolam resulted in a higher incidence and severity of myoclonus (including moderate and severe grades of myoclonus). The duration of myoclonus in the sufentanil group was also less than that of the midazolam group. Due to the findings of the current study, in the sufentanil group, HR reduced after induction, but the mean difference in MAP was not clinically significant after sufentanil administration.</p><sec
