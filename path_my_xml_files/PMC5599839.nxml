seated position for one hour, lumbar and pelvic inclination angle change, in subjects with
and without active lumber support. [Subjects and Methods] Fourteen healthy subjects
randomized into two groups sat on a floor chair, placed on an office chair, that
cyclically changed its lumbar supporting shape to provide active lumbar support (ALS) or
no ALS for one hour. Before and after, we measured the frequency of muscle waveforms of
the trunk extensor muscles when the subjects lifted an object weighing 10% of their body
weight, using both hands while seated. In addition, ROMt (Range of motion test) of trunk
rotation, degree of fatigue and muscle stiffness were analyzed. [Results] Muscle frequency
while lifting the weight decreased significantly without ALS compared to with ALS. Mean
muscle stiffness increased, ROMt decreased in desk work task significantly without ALS
compared to with ALS. [Conclusion] These results suggest that the lumbar muscles became
fatigued, because low frequencies, increased muscle stiffness, and decreased ROMt without
ALS. We suggest lumbar muscle fatigue was maintained low for subjects seated in a chair
with ALS.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Muscle fatigue</kwd><kwd>Active lumbar support</kwd><kwd>Low back pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Recent studies have shown an association between prolonged and low back pain (LBP)<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Occupational LBP has become a major problem in industrial health<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The major causes of LBP include handling heavy objects,
standing up for long periods of time, and performing tasks while seated, with further
investigation of the latter finding that fatigue in the lumbar muscles caused by maintaining
a seated position for a long period of time can lead to LBP<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. One representative bad
sitting posture is a head forward position<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, involving bending of the waist. In this position, the head is
located more anteriorly than in control subjects, leading to acute LBP<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. An increased bending posture increases the shearing force
on the lumbar vertebrae and the compressive force on the vertebral duct, reducing tissue
tolerance<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been estimated that
50&#x02013;80% of the population experiences LBP, which negatively affects daily life and task
perfbrmance<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Chronic low back pain
(CLBP), defined as LBP sustained for &#x0003e;12 weeks<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, has been associated with various motor control problems, including
damage to postural adjustment<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> and delay
in muscular response<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Lumbar support devices, which support the lordosis of the back side of the lumbar region,
have been commercialized and used frequently. Pelvic anteversion has been reported
significantly higher in the presence than in the absence of lumbar support<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. General lumbar support can maintain
lordotic lordosis and anteversion of the pelvis, resulting in a posture in the sitting
position close to the ideal physiological lordosis. However, even with general lumbar
support, maintaining the same posture for a long period of time may reduce tissue tolerance
of the lumbar loading structure, accompanied by sustained stress and increased tissue
viscosity. Although the application of sustained stress to viscoelastic tissue leads to a
creep phenomenon that causes tissue deformation, a creep phenomenon, even in the lumbar
region, has also been observed after sustaining a bending posture for 20 minutes<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Tissue tolerance may decrease while
viscous friction increases after maintaining the same posture for a long time, and may also
occur after maintaining an intermediate waist posture. Furthermore, deformation caused by
the creep phenomenon has been associated with microscopic damage to the tissue<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moving one&#x02019;s waist while in a sitting
position may prevent the deleterious effects on posture of maintaining the same position for
a long period of time.</p><p>We have therefore constructed a prototype active lumbar support (ALS) chair with an
automatic shape-changing function that automatically moves the waist during sustained
sitting in a poor desk work environment and everyday life. Using ALS may reduce fatigue of
back muscles and lumbar soft tissue. This study investigated the effects of ALS on lumbar
muscle fatigue by measuring the latter before and after maintaining a seated position for a
long period of time with and without transitive pelvic angle changes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study subjects comprised 14 healthy individuals, seven men and seven women, of mean age

fatigue by transitively changing the pelvic angle when a person performs seated tasks for
long periods of time. The ALS regularly pushes the lower back anteriorly to prevent
prolonged sitting in the same posture. The subjects were required to maintain a desk work
seated position for one hour. Subjects in the control group sat on the device without ALS
activated; whereas ALS group subjects sat on the device with ALS activated. The device was a
newly developed small floor chair, placed on an office chair, which could have ALS switched
to on or off. (Rinnza Auto, Labonetz Inc. Japan; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.

frequencies, increasing muscle stiffness, and decreasing ROMt. Muscle stiffness was lower
after sitting on a chair with ALS, suggesting a reduction in extendibility of the lumbar
muscles. The ALS prototype was designed to generate sustained passive movement of the waist
and pelvic region while sitting. A previous study assessing whether the waist actually moves
while being seated in the ALS prototype found that inflating to the second stage of ALS
resulted in an average anterior pelvic inclination angle of 1&#x000b0; and that the average forward
motion of the waist at the third lumbar level was 8&#x02005;mm (p&#x0003c;0.05)<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, tissue stiffness in the lumbar region was regarded
as associated with reduced ROMt, due to increased muscle fatigue in the normal seated
position and increased muscle stiffness. Chronic pain has been found to increase muscle
fatigue<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muscle fatigue generated by
maintaining muscular contractions while being in the same fixed sitting posture has been
found to cause chronic lumbar pain. Although the differences were not statistically
significant, even in VAS, sitting on the ALS prototype, even for 1 hour, was not associated
with fatigue. These findings indicate that the ALS could maintain a sitting position with a
comfortable posture.</p><p>Electromyogram frequency is dependent on type of muscle fiber, with Types I and II being in
the low and high frequency regions, respectively. Suppression of activity due to fatigue of
Type II fibers result in MPF and MDF gradually becoming lower. When MDF of the lumbar muscle
was compared with MPF while lifting 10% of body weight for about 1 hour in the sitting
position, we found that frequency was lowered only on the left side (<xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). This may have been due to muscle fatigue in the normal
seated position in the absence of ALS, resulting in the muscles having a low frequency
immediately after lifting the weight. Despite the non-occurrence of lumbar muscle fatigue
when performing ALS after performing the Sorensen test<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, ALS was regarded as less likely to cause lumbar muscle fatigue.
However, because there was a significant difference only in the left hip, further study is
considered necessary. The ROMs of flexion and extension have been reported significantly
increased following lumbar exercise<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>,
suggesting that mild exercise of the lumbar region can expand ROM.</p><p>Maintaining a fixed posture, whether standing or sitting, for a long period of time is a
cause of LBP<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of the present study suggest that moving the lumbar
area, including the pelvis, through automatic air injection and removal while sitting, can
prevent or reduce fatigue in the lumbar muscles. The major limitation of this study was that
all subjects were in the same age group (mean age, 21&#x02005;years). Therefore, these findings
require verification in other age groups. Additional studies are also required to analyze
the relationships of ALS degree of expansion and cycle time with tissue tolerance and muscle
fatigue, thereby optimizing ALS parameters.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Dankaerts</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>O&#x02019;Sullivan</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Burnett</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Differences in sitting postures are associated with
