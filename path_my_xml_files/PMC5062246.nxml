However, both laryngoscopy and intubation are noxious stimuli and are associated with hemodynamic responses such as hypertension and tachycardia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The increase in the heart rate (HR) and blood pressure are usually transitory, variable, and unpredictable. Intravenous anesthetic induction agents do not adequately suppress the hemodynamic responses produced by endotracheal intubation.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Besides minimizing the cardiovascular response, anesthesia induction for patients at risk must also satisfy the following requirements. It should neither be time-consuming nor affect the duration or modality of anesthetic technique and also should not have any effect on the recovery characteristics of the patient.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine, a novel &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonist, has numerous applications in anesthesia and Intensive Care Unit because it causes sedation, hypnosis, analgesia, and sympatholysis.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Various studies have found that dexmedetomidine decreases the hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Different dose has been tried for the same.</p><p>Thyroid surgeries pose a multitude of challenges to an anesthesiologist. The commonest implications during such procedures involve the management of a potentially difficult airway, especially in cases of retrosternal goiter, and an enlarged thyroid gland compressing over the trachea for a prolonged duration.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Very few literature are available on the usage of dexmedetomidine for thyroid surgeries.</p><p>Hence, this study was aimed at studying the effectiveness of intravenous dexmedetomidine, 0.6 &#x000b5;g/kg body weight on hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in patients undergoing thyroid surgeries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind study was done at Adichunchanagiri Institute of Medical Sciences Hospital, BG Nagar, using intravenous dexmedetomidine 0.6 &#x000b5;g/kg body weight for attenuation of hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in patients undergoing thyroid surgeries during a period of 1 year between January 2015 and December 2015.</p><p>The study was undertaken after obtaining ethical committee clearance as well as informed consent from all patients. Sixty euthyroid patients, scheduled for elective thyroid surgeries under general endotracheal anesthesia belonging to American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II were selected for the study. As all 60 patients were taken for thyroid surgeries electively, preoperative optimization of thyroid function was done adequately. All patients were in euthyroid status before taking up for surgery.</p><p>The following patients were excluded from the study, those with cardiac, renal, hepatic, cerebral diseases and peripheral vascular diseases, known history of sensitivity and contraindications to drugs used, noneuthyroid at the time of surgery, patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus, patients coming for emergency surgeries, anticipated difficult airway, pregnant females, and time for laryngoscopy and intubation exceeding 15 s.</p><p>Patients with relatively large swelling of thyroid were not considered for the study anticipating difficult airway. Furthermore, patients on beta blockers were not considered for the study as it can interfere in the hemodynamic variables after administration of dexmedetomidine.</p><p>Routine investigations such as hemoglobin, white cell and platelet count, urea and electrolytes, and specific investigations such as thyroid function tests, serum calcium, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG), indirect laryngoscopy, and X-ray anteroposterior and lateral view of the neck was done in all patients.</p><p>The study population was randomly divided into two groups with 30 patients in each group using sealed envelopes containing the name of the group and patient is asked to pick up the envelope. The envelope was opened by a senior anesthesiologist who was assigned to prepare the solutions and was not involved with the study. Group A (<italic>n</italic> = 30) received injection dexmedetomidine 0.6 &#x000b5;g/kg body weight diluted to 10 ml of normal saline, administered intravenously over 10 min. Group B (<italic>n</italic> = 30) received 10 ml of normal saline, administered intravenously over 10 min.</p><p>All patients included in the study were premedicated with tablet alprazolam 0.5 mg and tablet ranitidine 150 mg orally at bedtime the previous night before surgery. They were kept nil orally 10 pm onward on the previous night.</p><p>On arrival of the patient in the operating room, an 18-gauge intravenous cannula was inserted, and an infusion of 500 ml Ringer lactate was started. The patients were connected to Star Plus Larsen and Toubro India Limited, multiparameter monitor which records HR, noninvasive measurements of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and continuous ECG monitoring and oxygen saturation. The baseline SBP, DBP, MAP, and HR were recorded.</p><p>After recording the baseline readings, patients in Group A, received dexmedetomidine 0.6 &#x000b5;g/kg body weight diluted in 10 ml normal saline intravenously over 10 min using syringe pump, 10 min before induction. Patients in Group B received normal saline 10 ml intravenously over 10 min using syringe pump, 10 min before induction.</p><p>The study drug was prepared by the senior anesthesiologist who was not involved in the study and as such, the observer as well as patient was blinded for the study.</p><p>All patients were premedicated with injection midazolam - 0.02 mg/kg body weight and injection fentanyl 1 &#x000b5;g/kg body intravenous (i.v.) after test drug administration. Then patients were preoxygenated for 3 min via a face mask with Bain's circuit. Anesthesia was induced with injection thiopentone as a 2.5% solution, in 25 mg increments till the loss of eyelash reflex. Endotracheal intubation was facilitated with 1.5 mg/kg i.v. succinylcholine 1 min before laryngoscopy and intubation. Laryngoscopy and intubation were performed using Macintosh No. 3 blade lasting for not more than 15 s and after confirmation of bilateral equal air entry and EtCO<sub>2</sub>, the endotracheal tube was fixed.</p><p>Anesthesia was maintained using 66% nitrous oxide and 33% of oxygen with 1% isoflurane. After the patients recovered from succinylcholine, the further neuromuscular blockade was maintained with vecuronium 0.05 mg/kg body weight initially and 0.5 mg increments as and when required. At the end of the procedure, patients were reversed with injection neostigmine - 0.05 mg/kg body weight and injection glycopyrrolate - 0.01 mg/kg body weight.</p><p>The cardiovascular parameters were monitored in the following time interval basal-before giving study drug, 1 min after laryngoscopy and intubation, 5 min after laryngoscopy and intubation and 10 min after laryngoscopy and intubation.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A sample size of 25 patients was needed to detect an intergroup difference of at least 10% in BP and HR with a power of 0.80 and &#x003b1; of 0.05. To make good for attrition rate, a total number of 30 patients in each group were included for the study. The independent samples <italic>t</italic>-test procedure compares means for two groups of cases.
