A major challenge facing health care decision makers is identifying cost-effective interventions due to lack of economic evidence. Our objective is to compare the cost-effectiveness of: 1) physician-based education and activation, 2) a rehabilitation program developed by Aviva Canada (a group of property and casualty insurance providers), and 3) the legislated standard of care in the Canadian province of Ontario: the Pre-approved Framework Guideline for Whiplash developed by the Financial Services Commission of Ontario.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The economic evaluation will use participant-level data from the University Health Network Whiplash Intervention Trial and will be conducted from the societal perspective over the trial's one-year follow-up.

We will identify the most cost-effective intervention using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and incremental net-benefit. Confidence ellipses and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will represent uncertainty around these statistics, respectively.

In the short-term, this injury leads to whiplash-associated disorder (WAD), a clinical syndrome characterized by neck pain and clusters of physical and psychological symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In the long-term, whiplash injury increases the incidence of future health problems. Persons with a history of whiplash are more likely to suffer from future neck pain, headaches, low back pain, shoulder pain and sleep disturbances, compared to those without a history of whiplash [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. WAD represents an important and growing burden both in terms of direct medical costs (associated with health care use) and indirect costs (associated with productivity changes, lost earnings capacity, and time contributed by caregivers) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Most industrialized countries have seen a rise in the incidence of hospital visits for traffic-related WAD over the past 20 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In the Netherlands, the average annual incidence has increased 10 times over a twenty-year period, from 3.4 visits per 100,000 inhabitants (1970-1974) to 40.2 visits per 100,000 (1990-1994) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In Sweden, the annual cumulative incidence of emergency visits for WAD has increased from 83 per 100,000 inhabitants (1985-1986) to 302 per 100,000 (1997-1998) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>In the Canadian province of Ontario, health care resources used to manage traffic injuries within the automobile insurance system exceed those used by the Workers Safety and Insurance Board system for similar injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A recent assessment of sprain and strain (mainly whiplash) injuries from 2004 - 2007 by the Ontario insurance industry found that despite a 20% increase in costs over the 3-year time period, the percent of claims closed within the expected time frame for soft tissue injuries declined dramatically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Thus WAD claims have increased in duration, despite the fact that more health care resources have been directed to WAD management. Drivers in Ontario consequently pay much higher automobile insurance premiums compared to drivers in other Canadian provinces where automobile insurance is also sold by private companie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. About, 5% of Ontario motorists' disposable income is spent on auto insurance, whereas motorists in Alberta and the Atlantic provinces pay 3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Recent scientific studies have also observed that increasing health care use has not led to improved health outcomes in WAD patients. Two population-based studies in Saskatchewan found that higher health care use was associated with substantial delays in recovery that were not explained by injury severity or other factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Another study found that when compared to usual care, specialized rehabilitation programs did not benefit recovery from WAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. A 2006 randomized trial compared education and advice by general practitioners (mean number of visits = 3.0) to education and exercises by physiotherapists (mean number of visits = 12.7) in patients with WAD lasting more than four weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Patients in the general practitioner group reported lower levels of neck pain and headache intensity than patients treated by physiotherapists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Thus, a major challenge facing health care decision makers is identifying cost-effective interventions for WAD. But there are no economic evaluations of WAD interventions in the published literature. The recently published systematic review of the neck pain literature by the Bone and Joint Decade 2000-2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and Its Associated Disorders did not identify a single cost-effectiveness analysis of WAD treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Our objective is to conduct an economic evaluation alongside a pragmatic randomized trial that evaluates physician-based education and activation and two rehabilitation programs for managing WAD in real-world conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This paper describes the protocol of an economic evaluation alongside the University Health Network</p><p>Whiplash Intervention Trial (UHN WIT).

It reflects current guidelines and recommendations for the management of WAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. A primary care physician provides reassurance, education about WAD's favorable prognosis, encouragement to resume activities of daily living, and a recommendation to perform home stretching exercises. The physician prescribes medicinal or non-medicinal pain relief modalities (heat/ice), a physiotherapy visit for further instruction on home exercises, or both, based on clinical judgment. The physician determines whether the participant can be discharged or a follow-up visit is required at the end of the first visit. The participant is advised to contact the physician if the complaint persists or worsens.</p><p>If follow-up visits are required, the participant is re-assessed by the same physician (if the physician is unavailable, another physician associated with the trial re-assesses the participant). The intervention above is repeated and adapted to the participant's status according to the physician's clinical judgment (e.g., alternate pain medication is prescribed). Participants who do not recover six weeks post-collision, or improve but require more care, are referred for a multidisciplinary evaluation and enter the interdisciplinary rehabilitation intervention stream (described in the Soft Tissue Injury Care Model section below).</p></sec><sec><title>Pre-approved Framework Guideline for Grade I and II Whiplash-associated Disorders</title><p>The Pre-approved Framework is a clinical management guideline developed by the Financial Services Commission of Ontario, an arm's length agency of the Ministry of Finance which regulates traffic insurance in the province of Ontario. It is the legislated standard of care for Grade I and II WAD in Ontario. It focuses on the provision of interventions to manage pain and disability through functional restoration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The intervention is administered by a physiotherapist and includes: 1) reassurance, 2) education, 3) home exercises, and 4) encouragement to resume normal activities of daily living. The physiotherapist may also provide: 1) exercise and functional activities, 2) mobilization and manipulation, 3) non-medicinal pain management modalities (heat/ice, massage therapy), and 4) coping skills education. The frequency and number of visits is based on the physiotherapist's clinical judgment, but does not exceed 10 visits within the first three weeks and 9 visits three to six weeks after the collision date. The limit on the number of visits is a restriction of the Pre-approved Framework, not of the trial protocol.</p><p>Participants with clinically important functional limitations are eligible for a functional assessment of their home, work, or school environment. Based on the assessment, an occupational therapist develops an intervention that may include: 1) recommendation to use aids or devices, 2) minor modifications at the work, home, or school environment, 3) instructions on adaptive strategies or alternate approaches to fulfill functional tasks, and 4) specific functional activities to increase tolerance. Participants who report clinically significant improvement in the first six weeks of care, but have not recovered, can receive up to four additional treatments over a two-week period. Participants who have not recovered in the first six weeks of care are re-evaluated and a new plan of management is developed by the physiotherapist.</p></sec><sec><title>Soft Tissue Injury Care Model</title><p>The Soft Tissue Injury Care Model is a staged multidisciplinary rehabilitation program developed by Aviva Canada (a group of property and casualty insurance providers) as an alternative to the Pre-approved Framework guideline. A physiotherapist leads the intervention which includes three integrated and sequentially-administered rehabilitation phases: 1) acute-sub acute care, 2) multidisciplinary evaluation, and 3) interdisciplinary rehabilitation. During the acute-sub acute phase (first six weeks post-collision), care is delivered by physiotherapists, and if necessary, kinesiologists and massage therapists. Care consists of: 1) reassurance, 2) education, 3) home exercises, 4) physiotherapy modalities, and 5) massage therapy. A maximum of 9 treatments (including massage therapy) during the first three weeks post-collision and an additional 8 sessions (including massage therapy) between the third and sixth week post-collision is provided. The limit on the number of visits is a restriction of the Soft Tissue Injury Care Model, not of the trial protocol. The type and frequency of treatment prescribed by the physiotherapist is based on his/her assessment. During this phase, the physiotherapist may recommend an in-home or job-site functional assessment.</p><p>Patients who require treatment beyond the acute-sub acute phase are referred for a multidisciplinary evaluation. The purpose of the multidisciplinary evaluation is to identify barriers to recovery and recommend the appropriate treatment through an interdisciplinary rehabilitation program. The interdisciplinary rehabilitation program has three specific goals: 1) overcome psychosocial barriers to return to function, 2) physical restoration, and 3) functional restoration. The program includes up to five weeks of daily intervention (each session may last up to 51/2 hours). Frequency, duration and type of care are determined by the interdisciplinary team and may include a job-site assessment. Services provided during interdisciplinary rehabilitation may include: 1) education, 2) reassurance, 3) goal setting and advice on self-management, 4) psychological counseling and stress management, 5) relaxation therapy, psychotherapy and family counseling, 6) cognitive behavioral therapy, 7) instruction on pain management techniques, and 8) strength, endurance, flexibility or cardiovascular exercises.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Quality Control</title><p>All physicians and physiotherapists are trained by a trial coordinator during a formal training session. The session consists of a description of the study and instruction on the standardized intervention protocols. Clinicians receive printed materials to refer to.

Participants are assessed at 6 weeks, and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months from baseline.

Participants are asked: "How well do you feel you are recovering from your injuries?" at each follow-up. They are requested to select one of seven choices: 1) completely better; 2) much improved, 3) slightly improved, 4) no change, 5) slightly worse, 6) much worse, and 7) worse than ever. Participants who respond to have "completely recovered" or are "much improved" are considered to have recovered.

Co-interventions are measured by asking participants to self-report the type of health care provider consulted outside of the trial and the frequency of these visits. Participants are also asked to self-report medication use, including over-the-counter medication and drugs prescribed by heath providers not associated with the trial. A cross-validation will be conducted by checking self-reported co-interventions against the out-of-pocket expenses submitted by participants to Aviva Canada for reimbursement.

If participant baseline characteristics vary between interventions, a multivariable mixed-effect Cox proportional hazards model will be used to control for differences between groups. The proportional hazards assumption of a constant hazard ratio will be tested using graphical approaches, goodness-of-fit tests, and time-dependent variables. A stratified Cox procedure will be used if the assumption does not hold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Recurrences will be reported as rates (number of participants that report a recurrence per 28 days). Rates will be used because differences in participants' time-to-recovery could create a bias that favors less effective interventions (those with longer average time-to-recovery) since, in participants randomized to these interventions, there will be less observation time to observe potential recurrences. Time-to-recurrences will also be compared in a Cox proportional hazards model as above, with an additional covariate to account for differences in average time-to-recovery across interventions.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Economic Evaluation alongside the UHN WIT</title><p>The primary objective is to compare the relative cost-effectiveness of: 1) the legislated standard of care in Ontario for acute WAD, 2) physician-based Education and Activation, and 3) the Soft Tissue Injury Care Program, for persons with recent WAD injury, using participant-level data from the UHN WIT and Aviva Canada administrative claim files.

Therefore, expenses submitted by participants to Aviva Canada will be used as a proxy to a cost diary. At all follow-ups, participants also complete a questionnaire about access to health care for their whiplash injury beyond health care provided by the trial (i.e., publicly or privately funded or unfunded health provider services). Costs will be assigned to health provider visits using: 1) Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-term Care Schedule of Benefits (for physician visits, which are publicly funded) or 2) regulated health professions' recommended fee schedules (for acupuncture, chiropractic, massage therapy, naturopathy, physiotherapy visits, etc., which are not publicly funded).

An intervention that is cost-effective is thus defined as ICER &#x0003c; &#x003bb;. The Incremental Net Benefit (INB) equatio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. computes the net benefit of a health effect in dollars, by valuing the additional health effect (&#x00394;E) in dollars, and subtracting the associated additional cost (&#x00394;C) as follows:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="1471-2458-11-594-i2.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p>When the INB is positive, the value of a new treatment's extra benefits (&#x00394;E &#x000d7; &#x003bb;) outweighs its extra costs (&#x00394;C), implying that the decision maker values the extra effect more than the extra cost (i.e., &#x00394;E &#x000d7; &#x003bb; &#x0003e; &#x00394;C). Conversely, when INB is negative, the decision maker does not consider the extra benefit to be worth the extra cost.</p><p>We will use the net-benefit approac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. to measure the incremental cost-effectiveness of the interventions against a threshold value &#x003bb;, where &#x003bb; will be described as society's maximum willingness-to-pay for an additional: 1) QALY gained, 2) unrecovered day averted, and 3) recurrence averted over a 28 day period.

If there is unbalanced allocation in baseline characteristics, we will use net-benefit regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] which allows cost-effectiveness to be estimated directly in a regression framework. Net-benefit regression uses net-benefit as the dependent variable calculated from person-level effect (E<sub>i</sub>) and cost (C<sub>i</sub>) data for each patient i:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="1471-2458-11-594-i3.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p>In its simplest form, regression is then used to estimate:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="1471-2458-11-594-i4.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p>where &#x003b1; is the intercept term, t is an intervention dummy term (it equals 1 if the person received, for example, the new intervention and 0 for the usual care), and &#x003b5; is the stochastic error term. The regression coefficient &#x003b2; provides the estimate of the standard incremental net-benefit statistic. As there are two new interventions to test, we will use two treatment dummies, t1 and t2 (with corresponding coefficients &#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>). The regression estimate of &#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>will equal the incremental net benefit of physician-based Education and Activation compared to the Ontario legislated standard of care, and the regression estimate of &#x003b2;2 will equal the incremental net benefit of the Soft Tissue Injury Care Program compared to the Ontario legislated standard of care. Additional covariates can be added to adjust for unbalanced allocation in observed baseline covariates that could confound results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>].

First, cost-effectiveness will be re-evaluated with costs related to productivity changes included as these costs will not be included in the primary analysis. Second, the sensitivity of the results to using SF-6D versus rating scale quality-of-life weights to calculate QALYs will be tested. The rating scale approach consists of asking participants to choose a number that best represents their current health state on a scale anchored from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Finally, we will test assumptions about the long-term costs and effect of the interventions extrapolated beyond the 12-month time horizon, including the assumptions that: 1) after the 12-month period, the rate of recovery is identical, and 2) the interventions continue to confer the same rate of recovery.

Sensitivity analyses will be conducted, where reasonably likely scenarios are considered (e.g., missing observations are assumed to have a distribution of outcomes including recovery, recurrence, and no recovery). Cost and effect data will be analyzed with two approaches: 1) only participants with complete data are included (complete case analysis), and 2) all study participants are included, where imputed values for costs and effects in participants with missing data will be used (multiple imputation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>].
